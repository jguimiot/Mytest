Brenden Wysynski was arrested and charged as an adult with impersonating a peace officer on Monday September 9, a criminal complaint obtained by CNN affiliate KOAT said.  Wysynski did not respond to a Facebook message seeking comment. He has entered a not guilty statement.  His public defender, Carlos Scarborough said in a statement that they commonly don't see this type of charge.  At 12:30 a.m. Monday morning, a police officer with the Albuquerque Police Department said he was driving north on 4th St. near I-40 in Albuquerque, when he saw a car with red and blue flashing lights on it conducting what appeared to be a traffic stop, according to the complaint.  The officer drove by the cars when Wysynski waved at him, according to the complaint. That's when the officer says he turned around and stopped to find out what was going on.  New Mexico teen, posing as a deputy sheriff pulled over a white SUV for speeding  Wysynski, 18, identified himself and was wearing, according to the officer, \"regular clothing\" and a star shaped badge on his belt, the complaint said. He told the APD officer that he had worked for the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department for three years, police say.  \"I know, I know I'm underequipped,\" Wysynski can be heard saying in the APD body cam video.  When asked why he was conducting a traffic stop, Wysynski told the officer the white SUV he stopped had been driving 120 mph.  \"I was just heading over there to the court house,\" Wysynski said in the body cam video. \"I know it makes no sense, I caught him going 120 down I-40.\"  The officer asked for ID and about Wysynski's makeshift flashing blue and red lights attached to his car.  The officer told Wysynski to give the motorist he had unlawfully pulled over their documents back and the white SUV left the area, according to the complaint.  In the body cam video, the officer can be seen asking for a supervisor to assist him when Wysynski begins conversation again.  \"For starters, I know this looks really bad,\" Wysynski said in the body cam video.  While waiting for a BCSO supervisor to arrive at the scene, police say Wysynski gave his birth year as 1994, but police later confirmed he was born in 2001.  Wysynski eventually willingly admitted that he wasn't employed by BCSO and bought the badge online, according to the criminal complaint.  \"I'm just gonna be straight-up with you,\" Wysynski said in the body cam video. \"I'm not a cop.\"  When supervisors from both APD and BCSO arrived, Wysynski changed his story and told them the badge belonged to his late father, according to the complaint. When officers questioned him on that, he later admitted that he in fact bought the badge online, the complaint said.  Wysynski's attorney, Scarborough, said in a statement that his client was released on his own recognizance -- meaning he signed a written statement that he will show up to scheduled court appearances and not do anything illegal while waiting for a court date. In the state, those arrested on misdemeanor charges who don't have a prior criminal history are often released on their own recognizance, said Maggie Shepard, communications specialist at the New Mexico Law Offices of the Public Defender.  Sheriff Manuel Gonzales III from BCSO told CNN he's grateful the officer intervened when he did.  \"Incidents like this are extremely concerning and can impact our community greatly,\" he said in a statement. \"This individual was removed from our streets and will be held accountable for violating our public's trust in law enforcement.\"  \"I think it showed great police work on behalf on our officer,\" Gilbert Gallegos with APD told CNN. \"He wanted to see if the officer needed help, but when things didn't look right he took the time to figure it out.\"  At the end of the body cam video, the officer can be heard explaining what happened during his exchange with Wysynski.  \"It was just really weird,\" the officer said on the body cam video.

Outside, protesters denounced the 10-year sentence Guyger got as too lenient.  The conclusion of the trial mirrored the gamut of emotions displayed during the week-long proceedings, with Jean's parents taking the stand with poignant testimony about their son, Guyger saying she wished she were the one who was shot and prosecutors describing the former cop as negligent in missing myriad signs that would have tipped her off that she was on the wrong floor, in the wrong apartment.  Jurors convicted Guyger on Tuesday for murder in the fatal shooting of Jean. Wednesday, after hours of moving victim impact statements, the same panel sentenced her to 10 years in prison . She'll be eligible for parole in five years.  After the conclusion of a case that has become part of the national conversation around policing and violence against people of color, a group demonstrated in the streets of Dallas against a sentence they saw as too light.  NAACP President Aubrey Hooper said in a statement that the organization saw the sentence as inadequate, but prayed that Jean's family could find some closure with the conviction.  A The trial brought several moments of pain before the powerful example of forgiveness. video of Jean's final moments , as first responders worked to revive him from gunshot wounds, was shown while his family was in the courtroom. They left sobbing, and Judge Tammy Kemp said she hadn't considered the hurt it would cause his loved ones.  Then, Guyger took the stand to describe through tears the night she said she entered Jean's apartment thinking it was her own and shot the man she thought was an intruder. She said she wished she had been the one killed instead.  Botham Jean's younger brother Brandt Jean hugs convicted murderer and former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger.  \"I don't even want you to go to jail,\" he told Guyger. \"I want the best for you. Because I know that's exactly Botham would want you to do.\"  Thursday, Jean's father, Bertrum, told CNN that while he wishes Guyger's sentence would have been stiffer, he accepts the jury's decision.  \"I felt the same way as Brandt. I wish I could've extended that same courtesy,\" he said. \"That's what Christ would want us to do. ... If you will not forgive, neither will your Father forgive you. I don't want to see her rot in hell. I don't want to see her rot in prison. I hope this will help her to change and recognize the damage, the hurt that our family's going through. So I wish her well and I will pray for her family and pray for her as well.\"  Wednesday was a difficult day from beginning to end as family and friends sought to shine a light on a life that was lost and another that was destroyed. Jean's best friend described him as her \"absolute person\" and his father openly wept on the witness stand, talking about the loss of his son. Speaking on Guyger's behalf, a fellow officer listed her acts of selflessness and a former cocaine addict attributed her recovery to Guyger.  'What's really in her heart'  In closing arguments, prosecutors and the defense split on whether this was a case of a woman with prejudice or a public servant who made a terrible mistake.  Prosecutors introduced Guyger's controversial text messages and Pinterest activity.  while lamenting how long she had to work a MLK Day parade. \"They show what's really in her heart,\" one prosecutor told the jury. She argued the texts illustrated how Guyger was \"mocking\" the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. while lamenting how long she had to work a MLK Day parade.

To everyone who knew Botham, he was the brightest light in the room.\" It was a reference to Guyger's testimony, when she described seeing Jean in his apartment for the first time, saying she only saw a silhouette.  The defense urged the jury to look at 31-year-old Guyger's life as whole -- her years-long dream of becoming a police officer and how she \"put her life on the line every day\" at work -- rather than snapshots of life through texts or social media comments.  Defense attorney Toby Shook acknowledged there have been police shootings in which police get off when they shouldn't have, but he asked the jury not to bring their opinions into the deliberations.  \"This case is not those cases,\" he said.  \"This event wasn't planned,\" he said. \"This was so unique, you'll never see it again.\"  The sentence  For the sentence, prosecutors had urged the jury to choose no fewer than 28 years, the age Jean would have turned on Sunday. The defense team asked them to consider Guyger's life and service as a police officer.  The jurors had to choose between five and 99 years or life in prison. They made their decision in less than 90 minutes.  The room was silent when the judge announced the 10-year sentence. After the jury left, the Jean family sat silently, almost shell-shocked. The prosecution team also largely sat quietly, looking surprised themselves. Guyger was quickly escorted away.

Shouts of \"no justice, no peace\" could be heard in the hallway. Protesters were pushed back away from the courtroom farther down a hallway, and Guyger's family was escorted out a secure pathway.  Lead prosecutor Jason Hermus walked over to the Jean family in the silent, mostly empty courtroom after the sentence.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I can't explain that.\"  Jean's father shook his hand. \"You fought a good fight.\"  'This is where you start'  Brandt wasn't the only one who sought to comfort Guyger.  In another shocking moment, Judge Tammy Kemp -- who gained national attention for her strict and stern style in the courtroom -- also approached Guyger. She brought her Bible.  \"You can have mine.

A longtime Republican foreign policy expert who was seen in the White House as not fully \"on the Trump train,\" Volker is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry examining allegations Trump deployed the machinery of state in a vendetta to target political rivals.  Volker's testimony, analysts say, could be damaging to the President and his allies.  Volker is seen as \"a well-respected straight shooter who is likely to testify in ways that will damage other Trump allies,\" Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, wrote in an emailed analysis. \"It's possible others, including key administration members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr would also be forced out.\"  Volker is also one of the State Department witnesses whose depositions to Congress Secretary of State Michael Pompeo tried to block, setting off a tussle with lawmakers who say they will interpret any effort to prevent the officials' appearances as obstruction.  Where will Volker appear and why?  Volker is now set to testify before the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees behind closed doors.  Dozens of pages of documents were delivered to those House committees Wednesday on behalf of Volker ahead of his Thursday deposition, two sources familiar tell CNN.  What remains unclear is if the documents were cleared by the State Department to be handed over, or if they are considered Volker's personal documents. The State Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment.  The announcement about his appearance came just hours before Volker resigned from his State Department position Friday, following release of the whistleblower complaint and a White House transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  In that call, Zelensky made clear that Ukraine, vulnerable and weak in the face of Russian aggression, wanted to buy American anti-tank missiles. Trump answered: \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\"  Trump pushed Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.  Trump also urged Zelensky to find a Democratic National Committee computer server that the US intelligence community says was hacked by Russian intelligence during the 2016 election campaign. There is no evidence Ukraine had any involvement in the hack.  The whistleblower complaint said that a day after Trump's call, Volker and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and provided advice about how to \"navigate\" Trump's demands.  The State Department said this summer that Volker put Ukrainian Presidential Adviser Andriy Yermak in contact with Giuliani, at Yermak's request.  A source familiar with Volker's thinking said he was trying to get the Biden-Giuliani issue off the table, given that it was a political effort and not one that he was meant to support in his State Department role.  Volker did not want the controversy to occupy the center of bilateral conversations either, the source said, and hoped that in connecting Giuliani with Yermak, it would lead to a conversation in which the Ukrainians would agree to look into the matter and it would eventually fizzle out in two or three years.  Giuliani, meanwhile, has repeatedly claimed that these meetings were arranged at the State Department's request, pointing to Volker as the official who reached out to arrange them and showing text exchanges on television to back up that claim.  In one of the texts Giuliani released, Volker is quoted as suggesting a phone call with Yermak and Giuliani. It is unclear just how involved Volker was with Giuliani's political efforts.  Giuliani's campaign  But Giuliani has directly pursued Ukrainian investigations into American politics and Trump's leading political rival Biden at least since the spring.  The former New York mayor has pushed for a probe into the call Biden made in 2016 -- alongside the European Union, International Monetary Fund and others -- for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Biden's son, Hunter, as a board member.  The prosecutor wasn't seen as tackling corruption aggressively, a key requirement for Ukraine to be considered for membership in the European Union.  In May, Giuliani floated traveling to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky in an effort to push the country to investigate Biden, as well as matters connected to the release of negative information about Paul Manafort, the former chairman for Trump's 2016 campaign. He ultimately reversed course and decided not to go.  In August, Giuliani said he had spoken to Yermak several times over the phone and met him in Madrid.  On Wednesday, the State Department inspector general provided Congress with dozens of pages of documents that included materials Giuliani had given the department earlier this year. Those documents, which were obtained by CNN, included the unsubstantiated claims about Biden and his son that formed the basis of Trump's accusations in his July call with Zelensky.  The whistleblower said in the complaint that in his understanding, Volker was trying to \"contain the damage\" inflicted on US policy by Giuliani and help Ukrainian officials \"navigate\" Trump's requests.  If Volker knows details of Giuliani's efforts, lawmakers will likely probe to learn as much as they can.  Who is Volker?  Volker is the executive director of the McCain Institute, which focuses on leadership, and kept that position even after being tapped in July 2017 by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to become special envoy to Ukraine.  He has served as an ambassador to NATO, a European and Eurasian affairs expert at the National Security Council, and a deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. He got his start at the CIA as an analyst.  As representative, Volker has been at the heart of efforts to keep US military and economic aid flowing to Ukraine. He had also been the US point-man in trying to get dialogue started between Russia and Ukraine over the separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine, now in its sixth year.  In Kiev, Volker was seen as a reliable advocate. Yermak told CNN Saturday that Volker's \"consistent and comprehensive support for Ukraine throughout his tenure means a lot for our country.\"  But almost a week later, Pompeo and the State Department have said nothing on the record about Volker's resignation.  'The Trump train'  Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted that \"one could hardly overestimate\" Volker's contribution to strengthening of our strategic partnership\" with the US.  But Volker, who worked as a special representative on a part-time, volunteer basis, didn't have a close relationship with the White House. Volker was not on the July 25th call with Trump and during his tenure, never had a one-on-one meeting with the President, a source close to the former special representative said.  A White House source has told CNN that Volker, an ally and protegee of prominent Republican Trump critic Sen. John McCain, never became a member of the President's inner circle. And according to another source, after Volker's resignation, there was little love lost for him inside the White House, where he was seen as \"never fully on the Trump train.\"  In a letter to trustees of the McCain Institute on Saturday, Volker wrote that Congress had requested his testimony and he would \"be complying with that request.\"", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T17:34:49", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/3Eb8CvlP2LE/index.html", "title": "Elizabeth Warren announces labor plan to empower workers and raise wages", "text": "Washington (CNN) Massachusetts Sen.

That effort included an event Thursday in Florida, where Trump signed an executive order that underscores the benefits of preserving the status quo for Medicare, in particular Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers.  In a raucous campaign-style event, Trump claimed Medicare is \"under siege\" and that Democrats want to destroy it.  \"These people on the other side, these people are crazy. They want to take it away, give you lousy health care,\" he said. \"We are making your Medicare even better and we're not letting anyone, it will never be taken away from you.\"  Trump's piecemeal approach risks leaving him -- and, perhaps more crucially, vulnerable down-ballot Republicans -- without a coherent alternative in a race that could center largely on competing ideas for health care.  Nothing is likely to move on Capitol Hill as the White House and Congress focus on the impeachment inquiry engulfing Trump's presidency. However, even before the House began those proceedings, the administration had little in the way of an overarching design for health care.  The White House had planned to start pumping out health-related initiatives on a near-weekly basis over the summer, aides said, but mass shootings, travel and other events have scrambled those plans. Now, Trump's team has laid out a blueprint for a series of announcements through the fall, with upcoming rollouts planned for an Oval Office event and a speech on the road in the weeks ahead, a senior administration official said.  Aides and allies point to what the President has already done to lower drug prices, combat opioid addiction and offer lower-cost alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.  Lack of vision  Since the start of Trump's presidency, Republicans have struggled and failed to agree on a unified vision for health care to offer up as a substitute for the landmark health reform law they've vowed to destroy, though Trump has said Republicans will be \"the party of health care.\" And Democrats, emboldened by the midterm gains they achieved largely by focusing on health care, are eager to contrast their ideas for universal health coverage with a Trump approach to health care that has felt piecemeal at best and nonexistent at worst.  What's more, the political calculations for Trump could change again later this year if an administration-backed lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act succeeds. In that case, a patchwork quilt of proposals may not be enough to convince voters Trump and Republicans are prepared to fix a newly collapsed system.  Back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in August forced the White House to postpone Trump's first planned trip to The Villages for a Medicare speech -- which aides said needed to be retooled before a redo of the policy announcement. Trump will deliver that speech Thursday at an official event with a distinctly political title: \"Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction.\"  The order will highlight the benefits of Medicare Advantage, which the Trump administration has been heavily promoting since 2017. It aims to give insurers more flexibility to offer telehealth and supplemental benefits, as well as to make it easier for seniors to sign up for these plans, which are offered by private insurers and have been growing in popularity. It will also allow Medicare Advantage enrollees to receive cash rebates to push them to receive high-value care.  Notably, the administration wants to make sure that traditional Medicare \"is not advantaged or promoted over Medicare Advantage,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  A senior official said Trump holds regular meetings with policy staff who brief him on the progress of his various health initiatives. The President asked his team to put together proposals he can tout on the campaign trail, and the senior administration official said Trump \"raises health care on his own, every week.\"  Led by Joe Grogan, head of the Domestic Policy Council, top aides -- including Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Azar -- have worked to develop initiatives Trump could pursue through executive action. Some are still in the works heading into 2020. Others already announced include a controversial proposal to require hospitals post the prices they negotiate privately with insurers and one that seeks to transform kidney care for the more than 37 million Americans with kidney disease.  Prospects for a legislative solution to health care before the election are increasingly dim, however. Trump tried unsuccessfully in March to rally Republicans behind devising an Obamacare replacement that few lawmakers wanted to touch, given how costly the GOP's failure to pass one the first time was at the polls.  Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are optimistic that legislation addressing prescription drug pricing and \"surprise\" medical bills could see some movement before the election, given bipartisan support for addressing both problems. The President has urged Congress to address both issues, and the White House backs the policies behind both bills.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have proposed legislation that would protect patients from getting hefty surprise bills if they unwittingly go to out-of-network doctors, particularly in emergency situations, but momentum has slowed amid heavy lobbying by both insurers and medical providers. While both chambers are also looking at drug price bills , that effort will likely be overshadowed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent proposal that calls for allowing the federal government to negotiate prices on some drugs -- a non-starter for Republicans.  Election-year challenges  Running on fundamental change, however, is not a strategy typically employed by sitting presidents, who do their best to persuade voters not to change the status quo.  \"I can't think of the last time an incumbent President campaigned on a specific comprehensive overhaul of anything, much less health care,\" said Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"I also think the new reality of health care politics is that anybody who has a plan that would disrupt coverage for current beneficiaries is playing with fire.\"  Many of the Democrats leading in the race to take on Trump next year have advocated either for a national health insurance system, such as \"Medicare for All,\" or at a minimum for adding a government-backed public option to the Obamacare exchanges. The Trump campaign has seized on some of the most controversial elements of the progressive plans to bolster its overarching theme -- that Democrats are too far left -- but has otherwise done little in the way of promoting a health care alternative. Campaign advisers say they've heard little talk of positive messaging on the issue, despite how dominant the topic is on the other side of the aisle.  Trump's aides and allies remain confident their negative messaging on Democratic health care plans will resonate. Most are hopeful Democrats' shift toward what conservatives have described as a government takeover of health care will serve as a fruitful line of attack for Trump.  The shift was evident in a briefing call administration officials held with reporters ahead of the order. Grogan stressed that the President's vision for a healthier America goes beyond the Affordable Care Act, \"which at the end of the day is not that many people.\"  He sought to contrast what steps Trump has taken with the Democratic candidates' push for Medicare for All, evoking a familiar attack that it would lead to Medicare for none.  \"While President Trump has expanded health care choices and decreased costs, not to mention lowered prescription drug prices and increased transparency in the industry, 2020 Democrats want to go far beyond Obamacare,\" said Daniel Bucheli, a Trump campaign spokesman. \"The 2020 Democrat field is embracing a government takeover of health care under the 'Medicare-for-all' banner that would eliminate private insurance, increase wait times, and decrease the quality of medical care.\"  While polls show that Americans want elected officials to lower health care costs, many are not ready to embrace a national health plan such as Medicare for All. Nearly 69% of the public favor a public option, which would compete with private plans, while 53% support Medicare for All, according to a September Kaiser Family Foundation poll  Democratic candidates have repeatedly attacked Trump for hurting Americans' health care, and experts say the President is seeking to show what he has accomplished amid those accusations.  \"The President is really focused on making his mark on health care,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, managing director at Manatt Health, a professional services firm, who worked in the Obama administration to implement the Affordable Care Act. \"It's not surprising that, as the election is starting to ramp up, we're seeing a lot of efforts from the administration to show movement and progress on some of these priorities, given that repeal and replace really stalled.\"", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T11:05:53", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/m4IqlRKPFCg/index.html", "title": "Justice Ginsburg declares her good health, but high-stakes scrutiny persists", "text": "Washington (CNN) In the six weeks since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg revealed she had endured another cancer ordeal, she has made more than 10 public appearances, animated and \"very much alive.\" Yet advocates with a stake in another Supreme Court confirmation battle cannot help but be on edge.  If the 86-year-old, four-time cancer survivor were to leave the bench at any point during the rest of a Trump presidency, it would set in motion a succession fight like no other. President Donald Trump would be securing more than a third lifetime appointment to the high court. He would be replacing an unerring liberal, a women's rights icon, with a conservative.  That would thrust the court rightward in a way not seen since 1991 when conservative Justice Clarence Thomas succeeded Thurgood Marshall, himself a civil rights legend. The court already has a 5-4 conservative advantage.  Such stakes for the law have necessarily roused many in the nation's capital as well as people across the country following the moves of the \"Notorious RBG\" and offering public wishes for her good health.

The list of 25 potential Supreme Court candidates was last updated in November 2017 and was one way Trump back in 2016 sought to assure Republican voters he would appoint a strong conservative to the bench.  \"It would be both smart politics and good governance to update the list,\" Shapiro wrote on The Federalist, a conservative website.  Liberals, meanwhile, are preparing their own list of recommendations for the high court, hoping that the next vacancy does not occur until a new president is elected in November 2020, and that the winner is a Democrat.  \"The fight to replace Justice Ginsburg would have a different tenor to it,\" said Christopher Kang, chief counsel of the liberal advocacy group Demand Justice, yet he adds, \"For us, the thing that engages progressives far more than RBG's prominence is Brett Kavanaugh's sheer presence on the court.\"  As Demand Justice compiles a list of possible nominees to recommend to Democratic presidential candidates, it is organizing with other liberal groups a protest at the Supreme Court for Sunday to mark the one-year anniversary of Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation.  Trump continues to vigorously defend Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to succeed centrist-conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy last year. Trump used Twitter to swat back recent criticism triggered by renewed complaints of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh in his youth. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations.  In a September 15 tweet, the President declared of critics, \"They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!\" The next day Trump added, \"Do you believe what these horrible people will do or say. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions -- but played the game badly.\"  If a high court seat were to open over the next year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would not adhere to his 2016 election-year stance. After Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly on February 13, 2016, and President Barack Obama nominated US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland, McConnell blocked any consideration of Garland, saying the next president should name Scalia's successor. (Trump chose Neil Gorsuch in 2017.)  McConnell in September told radio host Hugh Hewitt he would \"absolutely\" move on a nominee in the 2020 election year. McConnell has differentiated his 2016 stall from possible 2020 action by noting that the White House and Senate are now controlled by the same political party. This time, McConnell has observed, there would be no expected conflict between his Republican majority and a Democratic White House.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats labeled McConnell a \"hypocrite\" earlier this year when he made his new position clear.  \"There was nothing I did (in 2016) that ... would not have been done had the shoe been on the other foot, had there been ... a Republican president and a Democratic Senate,\" McConnell insisted to Hewitt. \"So look, they can whine about this all day long. But under the Constitution ... the President makes the nomination, and the Senate confirms.\"  Last term for the current nine?  As the 2019-2020 Supreme Court session begins, an imminent question is whether this could be the last for these nine justices.  Ginsburg is one of three justices who are over 70. Stephen Breyer, who is also an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, is 81, and Thomas, an appointee of Republican President George H.W. Bush, is 71.  Neither Ginsburg nor Breyer have displayed any interest in retiring. Thomas might be most inclined to leave the bench while a Republican holds the White House. But Thomas, now the leader of the far right of the court, has told close associates he hopes to remain for many more years.  Ginsburg said that her travel and speaking agenda enhances her healing. \"It's a necessity to get up and go,\" she said in a September appearance in New York City . \"It's stimulating, and somehow all these appearances that I've had since the end of August, whatever my temporary disability is, it stops and I'm OK for the time of the event.\"  Since the Supreme Court revealed on August 23 that a malignant tumor on her pancreas had been detected and treated, Ginsburg has spoken in Buffalo, Washington, DC, New York City, Little Rock, Raleigh and Chicago, some places multiple times.  List-keeping  A White House spokesman said this week that the administration would have no comment on whether Trump's list of Supreme Court candidates was being updated. He also declined to comment on any other matters related to the administration's readiness for any Supreme Court opening.  Leonard Leo, a Federalist Society leader who has steered multiple GOP Supreme Court selections, including that of Kavanaugh, told CNN recently, \"I think it's inappropriate to be having 'what if' discussions about Justice Ginsburg's health. But the fact that the left is talking so much about Justice Ginsburg demonstrates her importance to them as a symbol and the intensity of the kinds of campaigns they would wage over Supreme Court vacancies in the future.\"  Among the people on the Trump Supreme Court list who met with the President during past selection processes and could be likely finalists are US Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barret of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals and 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amul Thapar, a Kentucky favorite of McConnell.  Demand Justice's Kang said the group is compiling a list to be released by the end of the month. Kang and Brian Fallon, who with Kang co-founded Demand Justice in 2018, wrote in an The Atlantic that Democratic presidents should look to people who have represented workers, consumers or civil-rights plaintiffs, rather than corporations. (Kang and Fallon both worked in the Obama administration.)  Among the names likely to be offered, based on Kang and Fallon's prior statements, are Sharon Block, a former National Labor Relations Board member, Pamela Karlan, a Stanford law professor, US Appeals Court Judge Cornelia Pillard of the DC Circuit, Bryan Stevenson, director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative, and Jenny Yang, a former chair of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  \"The list is not, literally, about one person and one vacancy,\" Kang said. \"It's about how to approach all vacancies\" on the Supreme Court and throughout the three-tiered federal judiciary.  McConnell has made a high priority of confirming Trump nominees to all levels of the federal bench, and he told Hewitt last month: \"We're not going to leave a single vacancy behind by the end of next year.\"", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T13:06:10", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/WICFirz-QLQ/index.html", "title": "Short clips, big risk: This mysterious startup wants to turn streaming on its head", "text": "Do you like Steven Spielberg and scary TV shows? Well, he's currently working on one, but there's a catch: it will only be available on mobile phones, at night.  Are you a fan of Jane Austen adaptations? That's great! There's a gay \"Pride and Prejudice\" inspired rom-com coming soon.  How about home renovation shows? Everyone likes those, right? Sure, but this one is a cross between HGTV and CSI, in that it only includes houses where infamous murders or crimes occurred.  Oh, and did we mention that these series will be diced up into short episodes \u2014 all just 10 minutes or less?  They're all part of the lineup for Quibi, a new streaming service to be launched in 2020 by two veteran CEOs \u2014 Meg Whitman of Silicon Valley (she previously headed eBay and Hewlett-Packard) and Jeffrey Katzenberg of Hollywood (he led DreamWorks Animation).  Their new startup, short for \"Quick Bites,\" is an odd proposition \u2014 and a risky one at that.  As the streaming wars heat up, companies like Netflix, Apple, WarnerMedia (CNN's parent company), NBCUniversal and Disney are all vying to be bigger and grander than their competitors. Whitman and Katzenberg are instead daring to go small.  The two are wagering a lot of money \u2014 and potentially their reputations as two of the business world's mightiest moguls \u2014 on a bet that consumers will pay for a mobile-only, short-form video service.  Quibi's staff, headquartered in Hollywood, is preparing to launch a short-form streaming service in April. The company has yet to release any trailers or previews of the product.  I think it's the biggest idea that we've ever done... I just know it's going to work.\" Jeffrey Katzenberg, cofounder of Quibi  The service also arrives after decades of viewers being conditioned to long-form storytelling on TVs and big screens. It's entering a market that's already overrun by short-form content from the likes of YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat, which is mostly free of cost.  In a world that has new streaming services pop up seemingly every week, will there be enough room for Quibi?  Short clips, big budgets  Katzenberg and Whitman's pitch for Quibi, which is set to launch in April 2020 for $4.99 a month with ads and $7.99 a month without, is simple yet distinctive. The service offers videos and series that are cut into segments shorter than 10 minutes. The content ranges from scripted, fictional series to news and sports highlights. And all of it can viewable only on mobile devices.  Unlike short-form videos on YouTube or Instagram, Quibi's content comes along with high production budgets more akin to major series, and an intriguing tech capability: The videos are filmed and edited to be viewed both horizontally and vertically.  Quibi CEO Meg Whitman brings Silicon Valley experience to the role. She previously served as CEO of Hewlett-Packard and eBay.  \"What we're trying to do is bring together the best of Hollywood and the best of Silicon Valley to make viewing short-form content on your mobile extraordinary,\" Whitman told CNN Business during an interview at Quibi's headquarters in Los Angeles. \"We've got Hollywood quality content with some really very innovative technology that makes viewing video on your mobile something quite different than what it is today.\"  Despite the high stakes, Katzenberg and Whitman are excited. \"I think it's the biggest idea that we've ever done,\" Katzenberg said.  \"I think we are doing something that is now such a well-established consumer habit. You have 2.5 billion people walking around with these televisions in their pocket,\" he added. \"They're already watching a billion hours of content every day. I just know it's going to work.\"  The former head of Disney Studios and DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg brings a long legacy as a Hollywood hit-maker to Quibi.  The company will license content that fits into one of three categories: \"Lighthouses,\" which include the service's premium videos, \"Quick Bites,\" or standalone episodes of reality and alternative programming, and \"Daily Essentials,\" consisting of sports and news coverage.  Quibi has also brought in a lot of A-list talent. There's Spielberg, but also other big names like Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro, Anna Kendrick, Tyra Banks, Sophie Turner and Liam Hemsworth. In the series \"Thanks a Million,\" Jennifer Lopez will give away money to someone, who in turn, will have to pay it forward to others. In \"Action Scene,\" Kevin Hart will play a comedic version of himself trying to land a role in an action movie.  While Whitman and Katzenberg plan to make easily digestible content, that doesn't mean it's going to be cheap. Its \"Lighthouses\" content will cost roughly $100,000-per-minute to produce, which puts it on par with some of the most expensive shows on TV.  Think \"Game of Thrones\" production costs, but for a series cut into smaller snackable episodes.  Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez and Kevin Hart are among the big names contributing short-form content to Quibi.  The risks  But will anyone want to watch a series on the scale of \"Game of Thrones\" in 10-minute episodes? And if they do, will viewers really appreciate the production quality on such a tiny screen?  \"Watching on your phone is actually become a very personal, intimate, connective moment,\" Katzenberg said. \"You put your earbuds in and you have a connection with that content that is actually amazing.\"  Katzenberg feels that younger audiences are thrilled with the mobile experience and \"will appreciate having the best talent in front of the camera and behind the camera.\" He also mentioned that YouTube stars and social media influencers, while creative and innovative, have never had the resources in short-form storytelling that Quibi will now provide.  Katzenberg and Whitman aren't the only ones betting on Quibi's success. The company has lured some deep-pocket investors including Disney and WarnerMedia, as well as the e-commerce company, Alibaba. It has reportedly raised $1 billion in funding  \"These are smart people,\" Katzenberg said of some of Quibi's investors and partners in Hollywood. \"They didn't do this to be nice.\"  Quibi employees meet to discuss the startup's marketing strategy leading up to its launch in spring 2020.  Of course, those investors are betting not just on Quibi as an idea, but on Katzenberg and Whitman, who have had their fair share of professional wins and losses.  Katzenberg's tenure at Disney in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by acclaimed and beloved films, including \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Aladdin.\" However, Katzenberg's boardroom battles with then-Disney chairman Michael Eisner in 1994 led to Katzenberg's very public exit  After launching DreamWorks with Spielberg and music mogul David Geffen, Katzenberg led DreamWorks Animation to hits like \"Shrek\" and \"Kung Fu Panda.\" He left the company after its sale to Comcast in 2016 and has maintained a low profile since then. Quibi now marks his ambitious return to Hollywood prominence.  As for Whitman, she helped grow eBay into one of the most notable internet brands in the world as president and CEO from 1998 to 2008. She then led Hewlett-Packard after suffering a political loss when she ran for governor of California in 2010 \u2014 a campaign where she reportedly spent more than $100 million, mostly of her own money . She then stepped down as HP's chief executive in 2017, after splitting it into two companies.  Despite Whitman and Katzenberg's impressive resumes, some critics continue to be dubious of Quibi's long-term viability.  \"Does Quibi truly solve a consumer problem?\" Andrew Hare, a senior vice president of research at Magid, told CNN Business. \"In a world with YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch...do audiences under 35 really desire another platform with more exclusive short-form video?\"  In a world with YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch...do audiences under 35 really desire another platform with more exclusive short-form video?\" Andrew Hare, senior vice president of research at Magid  Hare added that he wonders if consumers' viewing habits will change enough to give Quibi space to grow in the market. \"Sure, we watch snippets of content all day on our phones, but we will also watch six hours of 'Breaking Bad' in a row on big screens,\" Hare added.  Quibi has also been in the press lately as two executives have left the company, just months before launch. The high-level departures raised eyebrows in the industry  Then there's the price of it all. Will consumers want to spend money on Quibi? Hare isn't so confident.  \"I'm not sure we have much historic evidence that a younger demo is willing to pay much for short-form mobile video,\" Hare said. \"Consumers are looking at their budgets closer than ever. Many are paying for pay TV, HBO, Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and more already... It's really going to need to prove extraordinary value to consumers to drive subscription scale.\"  Katzenberg and Whitman are also taking a big risk releasing Quibi in the middle of the streaming wars. Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and Apple will all launch their new services in the coming months.  But, according to Whitman, Quibi isn't here to compete with Netflix, Disney+ or HBO Max. It's a \"completely different use case,\" she said.  \"When you watch the big streaming services, typically you're at home watching in front of a TV, really committing to at least a half an hour, sometimes an hour, an hour-and-a-half to get into a show and watch a full episode,\" she said. \"We're going after a different time of day.\"  She explained that Quibi is going after consumers' \"in-between moments\" whether that be waiting at a doctor's office or standing in line for a cup of coffee.  Whitman and Katzenberg meet with a colleague at Quibi's headquarters. They say their new streaming service aims to appeal to users during their \"in-between moments,\" whether that be waiting at a doctor's office or standing in line for coffee.  Although plenty of naysayers are skeptical about Quibi's potential, the same could have been said of streaming goliath, Netflix in its early days. Once seen as a non-threat to the industry , Netflix is now the company everyone else is chasing with more than 150 million subscribers worldwide.  Quibi's commitment to being mobile-only may be what makes it a truly revolutionary service, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed. \"The mobile phone is the most personal device in your life that virtually never leaves you. Just as we grew up with TVs, this generation is growing up with mobile,\" he said. \"If this becomes the must-have content service for the mobile generation, that would be a game changer.\"  If this becomes the must-have content service for the mobile generation, that would be a game changer.\" Rich Greenfield, analyst at LightShed  If Quibi takes off, it could have the potential to change the streaming market, how consumers think about short-form video and possibly even multimedia storytelling itself. But if it's a flop, Whitman and Katzenberg's Quibi's run in the streaming market could be short lived. Either way, the stakes are high.  Yet, Whitman says she and Katzenberg aren't too nervous and are \"having a great time working together.\"  \"We are in the best sense, risk takers. But that doesn't mean what we're doing is risky,\" Whitman said. \"We're not at the table rolling the dice \u2014 or if they are, they're loaded.\"", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T15:41:35", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/T6Vym-0vXKI/index.html", "title": "Shipping is one of the dirtiest industries. Now it's trying to clean up its act", "text": "London (CNN Business) In the port of Antwerp in Belgium, a small boat whizzes around, shuttling 16 passengers back and forth. The \"Hydroville\" is fast, silent and, most strikingly, it produces zero pollution.  Built by Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB), it's the world's first sea-faring vessel to burn hydrogen in a diesel engine. No carbon dioxide or sulfur oxides are released during the process. The ship produces some nitrogen oxide, but that's converted into harmless nitrogen and water by a catalyst. In one of the dirtiest industries in the world, it's a tantalizing glimpse of a cleaner future.  Owned by one of Belgium's oldest shipping families, CMB and its small boat are leading the way as the shipping industry tries to tackle its contribution to the climate crisis. \"Green hydrogen-based fuels are the only zero-emission solution in the long run,\" CMB CEO Alexander Saverys told CNN Business.  As bad as aviation  The United Nations warned in 2018that the world had 12 years to stem catastrophic levels of global warming , piling the pressure on international shipping to clean up its act. Ships areincredibly polluting, belching out millions of tons of greenhouse gases every year. They emit sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses, as well as carbon dioxide and methane, gases which cause global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere.  rising sea levels, the IMO \u2014 a UN body that regulates shipping \u2014 set a target last year of While the industry was excluded from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement because its emissions are hard to allocate to individual countries, the international community has started to act. Under pressure from island states threatened byrising sea levels, the IMO \u2014 a UN body that regulates shipping \u2014 set a target last year of slashing emissions by at least 50% by 2050 , compared to 2008. But achieving this ambitious goal requires ship owners to move away from fossil fuels and invest in cleaner technology, much of which has never been used on large vessels before.  The challenge is particularly acute because the choices shipping companies make now will play out over the next 30 years. \"We're building the ships today which will be in operation over the next three decades,\" Dr. Tristan Smith, an expert in shipping and energy at University College London's (UCL) Energy Institute, said in an interview with CNN Business. To stand any chance of meeting the IMO target, zero emissions vessels need to enter the fleet by 2030 at the latest, he added.  Little headway  the sustainability efforts of the world's largest operators. Since the IMO set its target, many of the world's largest shipping companies have made ambitious pledges to slash their emissions over the next three decades. For some, the first step was simple \u2014 reduce the speed at which their fleets ply the oceans. That has already resulted in emissions being cut by as much as 30%, according to a report by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) , which ranksthe sustainability efforts of the world's largest operators.  But sailing more slowly is only a short-term fix that won't do enough to hit the IMO target, according to CDP. Success requires new ships, new engines and new fuels. Major financial, regulatory and technical barriers have to be overcome, and so far much of the shipping industry is dragging its feet when it comes to innovation. \"Shipping companies are failing to push for the critical technologies required to reduce their carbon footprint,\" according to CDP. Just three of the 18 companies CDP ranked have a committee at board level responsible for tackling the climate emergency.  One of the frontrunners is Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company with $39 billion in revenue last year. It has pledged to become fully carbon neutral by 2050 and has invested $1 billion since 2014 in energy efficient technodoelogy. The company's head of sustainability, John Kornerup, told CNN Business that by 2030 Maersk intends to reduce emissions by 60%. \"If we want to be ready in 10 years, we need to get started now,\" he said. Maersk is running trials with different fuels and also developing electric batteries. Decarbonizing shipping requires \"a completely new propulsion technology,\" Kornerup added. But even Maersk, with its financial firepower, says it cannot make zero-carbon ships a reality without industry collaboration  The Mette Maersk, powered by an oil and biofuel blend, arrives in Hong Kong \u2014 Credit: Maersk  It's an approach CMB has already adopted. The company, which has won multiple sustainability awards since it was bought by the Saverys family in 2015, recently announced a partnership with Japan's Tsuneishi Facilities and Craft to build the world's first ferry that can run on hydrogen and diesel by 2021. CMB's strategy is about testing low-carbon technologies on smaller ships, such as the Hydroville, and then scaling them up. \"The Hydroville is a small project which aims 10 years ahead of its time,\" Roy Campe, CMB's research and development manager, told CNN Business.  If we want to be ready in 10 years, we need to get started now. John Kornerup, head of sustainability at Maersk  in the next decade. As a family-run business which was taken private in 2015, CMB is less constrained by shareholders than public companies such as Maersk. \"Coming up with new technologies involves risks and that is why there is almost no innovation,\" Campe said. The Hydroville is \"a splendid example of how a commercially-driven project can offer high sustainability gains,\" Antwerp Port Authority CEO Jacques Vandermeiren said last year. CMB plans to launch a hydrogen engine next year that can power larger vessels such as tugboats and barges. And it's hoping to launch the world's first hydrogen-powered container shipsin the next decade. As a family-run business which was taken private in 2015, CMB is less constrained by shareholders than public companies such as Maersk. \"Coming up with new technologies involves risks and that is why there is almost no innovation,\" Campe said.  Cleaner cruising?  Norwegian cruise liner Hurtigruten is pursuing different technology. It has just launched the world's first hybrid cruise ship. Powered by a combination of batteries and marine gas oil, the Roald Amundsen sailed from Tromso to Hamburg in July, producing 20% fewer emissions than other ships of the same size, according to Daniel Skjeldam, Hurtigruten's CEO.  \"To operate sustainably, you have to invest in new technology. This is a new green revolution that's coming,\" said Skjeldam, adding that the cruise sector has been lagging other industries when it comes to cutting emissions.  The MS Roald Amundsen, the first hybrid cruise ship in Hurtigruten's fleet, arrives in Tromso, northern Norway on July 3, 2019.  The cruise industry grew by almost 50% between 2010-2018 and the number of passengers increases by 4-6% each year, according to Cruise Lines International Association.  Carnival CCL An undercover investigation by Johns Hopkins University this year found that cruise ships generate dangerous levels of air pollution. And the world's largest cruise operator,, emitted almost 10 times more sulfur oxide \u2014 a highly toxic gas \u2014 than all 260 million cars in Europe in 2017, according to a review by non-profit Transport and Environment in June. A Carnival spokesperson told CNN the report was based on \"outdated numbers and differs dramatically from fuel data and emissions tracked on Carnival Corporation's vessels.\"  Despite the trials of new technology by companies such as Maersk, Hurtigruten and CMB, industry-wide progress is too slow. Big companies are hesitant to invest billions of dollars in new technology and there are few financial incentives and regulations in place to push them to do so. But experts say it is crucial that the industry does not wait to be forced to act.  \"The cruise industry should be front runners in introducing new technology and reducing emissions. We simply cannot wait for regulations,\" Skjeldam said.  Burning dead fish  The biggest challenge for the shipping industry is moving away from heavy fuel oil, a type of diesel used by most of the world's tankers and cargo ships. Battery technology is powering the clean vehicle revolution on land. But fully electric ships are unlikely to be sailing the seas by 2050. Electric batteries cannot store enough energy to propel deep sea vessels traveling long distances, experts say. Low carbon fuel may be the answer, UCL's Smith said.  Many companies are focusing on liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels as alternatives. By 2021, Hurtigruten aims to operate a fully hybrid fleet, retrofitting all its 16 ships with a combination of LNG, batteries and biogas. \"Almost half our fleet will be literally powered by nature, as we will replace engines with batteries, natural gas and biogas \u2014 made from organic waste such as dead fish,\" Skjeldam said.  The batteries on board the Roald Amundsen kick in whenever there is a surge in energy demand, Skjeldam explained. \"We use the batteries to take care of these peaks. When the engines produce excess energy, this is transferred into the batteries. This secures smooth and optimal running of the engines at all time, significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions,\" he said. \"LNG is substantially less polluting than conventional diesel fuel and utilizing LNG as a component in different hybrid set-ups is a major step towards achieving Hurtigruten's ultimate ambition of sailing emission free,\" he added.  Biofuel is a better alternative as far as Maersk is concerned. The company recently used a blend of fuels produced from plant waste to help power a container ship traveling from Rotterdam to Shanghai. By using the fuel mix \u2014 20% biofuels and 80% fuel oil \u2014 Maersk reduced the vessel's CO2 emissions by 85% or 1,500 tons, the equivalent of what 200 households produce each year. \"It's the only option for now,\" Kornerup told CNN Business.  The Mette Maersk ran on a blend of fuel oil and biofuels during a three-month round trip from Rotterdam to Shanghai.  as agricultural land is diverted. Still, even that has its problems. Using biofuels for shipping is \"a wasted opportunity to store CO2 and is only viable in very limited quantities,\" according to Smith at UCL. Using land to generate solar power is about eight times more efficient than biofuel production, he noted. According to a report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , mass adoption of biofuels is not the answer. Scientists say that ramping up their production would lead to a huge spike in global food pricesas agricultural land is diverted.  \"The biggest pitfalls are biofuels, which can't be scaled or enforced sustainably, especially in shipping. LNG and synthetic methane are other dead ends due to methane leakage and enforcement problems,\" Transport and Environment concluded in its 2018 report, 'Roadmap to Decarbonising European Shipping.'  The challenge of hydrogen  Hydrogen is one of the most promising solutions for companies looking to meet the IMO target as it is clean and suitable for all ship sizes. But this fuel also presents challenges. \"The storage of hydrogen is probably the biggest stumbling block. Compressed hydrogen takes 15 times more space compared to diesel for the same amount of energy,\" CMB CEO Saverys said.  Experts say companies should make the huge leap towards decarbonization by investing in dual combustion systems, which use a combination of diesel and low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or batteries. \"At the moment the cheapest way to operate is to continue using an internal combustion engine [which runs on diesel] and liquid fuel like hydrogen or ammonia that you have produced using renewable energy,\" according to Smith.  Blending fuel is at the heart of CMB's strategy. \"Our diesel-hydrogen engines are a natural transition towards hydrogen. Diesel can still be burnt as principal fuel (in case no hydrogen is available), which gives users peace of mind to adopt this new technology,\" Saverys said.  One of Hydroville's two hydrogen-diesel combustion engines.  More companies should adopt transitional solutions, according to CDP. In its report, Carole Ferguson, head of investment research, said companies should focus on \"step change innovations.\" \"There are no zero carbon technologies that you can apply on ships today that are viable,\" said Kornerup. \"But we simply need to speed up [innovation] because we only have 11 years.\"  The biggest barrier to achieving low-carbon shipping is cost. Hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels are much more expensive than diesel. A hydrogen-powered ship costs around $10-$15 million more to build than a diesel vessel, and the investment is hard to justify given the lack of incentives or regulation, according to Saverys.  \"The technology is already here,\" said Smith. \"What's lacking is the impetus.\"", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T19:50:02", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/FBAYgZXZA0w/index.html", "title": "The McRib is back. Here's why McDonald's doesn't sell it year-round", "text": "The fast food company announced Thursday that the barbecue sandwich will be available in over 10,000 restaurants as soon as Monday. But, McDonald's said, the menu item will only be around for a limited time.  The McRib returns as soon as next week.  That's by design. Seasonal items are an important marketing tool for the food industry, according to Alexander Chernev, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.  Limited releases almost give consumers a Pavlovian response. For example, when the weather turns colder, Starbucks customers habitually get excited about Pumpkin Spice Lattes. In November, customers come in to check out the new holiday cups.  \"When you have these exclusive products, which exist for a short period of time, it gives people a reason to come to the store,\" Chernev explained.  Starbucks SBUX McDonald's MCD Dunkin DNKN Coca-Cola's KO It's not justandthat come out with seasonal specials:' announced a whole slew of pumpkin-flavored treats in August. As the holiday season gets into full swing, we'll be sure to seeChristmas trucks, turkey sandwiches from Subway and more. In the spring, it'll be Girl Scout cookie time.  For fast food chains in particular, which rely on familiarity, holilday items can offer consumers some variety.  \"You need consistency because that's the brand mantra,\" said Chernev. \"But no matter how much you like something, consuming something different ... increases the enjoyment of what you consumed before.\"  Chernev says it's a neat marketing ploy: Although a specialty item may be exciting on its own, it can also remind consumers how much they like the basics.  Seasonal offerings can also give brands a chance to test a new product. When Starbucks announced the return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte two years ago, it also unveiled the Teavana Pumpkin Spice Chai Tea Latte.  And Chernev pointed out that seasonal menu items mean brands have something new to talk about every quarter.  Starbucks has said that's part of the rationale behind its seasonal drinks  \"We strive to provide our customers with unique, seasonal offerings to celebrate each season, and customer response has been extremely positive to that,\" a company spokesman said two years ago.  There are some basic supply-and-demand economics behind limited-time releases too: Scarcity can build hype.  \"It's a way to create excitement for the menu,\" said R.J. Hottovy, a consumer strategist for Morningstar.  Items that might be popular for a few months probably wouldn't generate enough year-round demand.  When the McRib debuted in 1981, it was a dud.

(CBS) \u2014 A New Jersey homeowner publicly apologized to his community at an NAACP meeting in Salem County for a Halloween display. The apology comes a week after his disturbing Halloween decoration of a dummy hanging from a noose sparked a controversy.  A picture of the display circulated all over social media, and it\u2019s a Halloween display the creator now regrets. Ryan McDonald says he didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone.  \u201cTwo weeks ago in Salem County, we had a noose hanging decoration out in Mannington,\u201d Salem County NAACP President Nelson Carney Jr. said.  It was a Salem County NAACP meeting unlike any other.  Residents gathered in the house of God to hear the reasoning behind McDonald\u2019s Halloween decoration that displayed a mannequin hanging from a noose in his front yard.  \u201cI constructed a gallows for a Halloween display that we were going to display for Halloween and I did not expect it to be impacted this negatively,\u201d says McDonald.  Not only did it impact the community, but the police also showed up to McDonald\u2019s front door asking him to take it down.  After realizing the effect the hangman\u2019s prop had on the community, McDonald removed the display and came to Thursday\u2019s NAACP meeting to publicly apologize. His apology was accepted by most, but one member took it a step further.  \u201cI\u2019m personally willing to pay for your first year of being a part of the NAACP, if you will accept it,\u201d the member offered.  \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d McDonald responded.  The Salem County community is choosing forgiveness and is hopeful this is an incident they can move on from.  McDonald says he will continue to decorate for Halloween but he won\u2019t be displaying the hangman\u2019s prop again.", "company": "cnnUS"}, {"published": "None", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/2gGw2rbjLw0/", "title": "Husband runs over wife, attacks her with machete in Bronx killing: police", "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video  THROGS NECK, the Bronx \u2014 A Bronx man is accused of running over his wife with a vehicle and then hacking her with a machete, killing her, according to police sources.

At one point, she felt her coworkers had looked at her medical records based on comments they made to her.She reported this to her boss, along with the so-called \"wall of shame\" in September 2016.The review into her claims went on for several months.In December, the hospital fired one person and issued a warning to another over accessing her private records.The investigation by the Maine Human Rights Commission found the exhibit contributed to a hostile work environment, but they did not find that the hospital had retaliated against her for reporting her concerns.Saint Mary's is operated by Covenant Health based in Massachusetts and apologized for what happened.\"Covenant Health and St. Mary\u2019s Health System does not tolerate or condone discrimination or harassment of any kind, for any reason.

We reached out the to event organizer for a comment. She sent us the following statement:  \"We have 2 private events every year for our students. These events have a dress code. This particular event 390 students bought tickets. Only 1 student had to be turned away and it was due to dress code.

A local photographer, Jennie Ellis, saw Melissa's Facebook post on social media. She offered to take pictures of Darcy for free since she could not attend the dance.

Gumbo Limbo said this time of year is known as \"washback\" season, where turtle hatchlings that made it out to the Gulf Stream are now starting to wash back up along our coast.  The nature center said 100 percent of washback turtles that have plastic in their intestinal tracts don't survive, like the turtle in that Facebook post.  \"It is safe to assume they each have plastic inside of them,\" said Whitney Crowder, the rehabilitation coordinator at Gumbo Limbo.  Crowder said they've seen 121 washbacks this season, and dozens have died.  \"Every single one that we have necropsied has had plastic in their system,\" said Crowder.

Fernando Fabian Alvarez, 36, of Mexico, was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn on Sept. 20 after an investigation led by the FBI Dallas Field Office.  \u201cThis Defendant exploited innocent citizens\u2019 trust in law enforcement to commit acts of violence,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox. \u201cWe will not tolerate criminals brazenly impersonating police.\u201d  \u201cPolice officers are trusted members of the communities they serve. When someone impersonates an officer, it violates the trust our citizens have in law enforcement,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno. \u201cThe FBI and its law enforcement partners encourage the public to report anyone they believe is a police impersonator. We will hold these individuals accountable for using a law enforcement uniform to harm others.\u201d  In May, Alvarez pleaded guilty to carjacking and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence in Addison.  According to his plea papers, Alvarez admitted that he and an accomplice, donning police uniforms and badges, approached their victim at an apartment complex, striking him in the face with a 9 millimeter pistol. They then placed the victims in handcuffs, bound his ankles and stuffed him into his own car.  While the victim was restrained inside the vehicle, a Mercedes Benz sedan, his apartment was burglarized and his valuables \u2013 including cash, jewelry, a smartphone, and a pistol \u2013 were taken from him.  Alvarez admits he and his accomplice later drove the helpless victim to another part of the apartment complex and abandoned him next to a trash dumpster. Alvarez then abandoned the Mercedes Benz in a parking lot.  At the sentencing hearing, Chief Judge Lynn noted that in addition to the armed carjacking offense, Alvarez admitted in his plea papers to committing other violent offenses in the Dallas area, including:  \u2022 A home invasion in Frisco, Texas on December 20, 2016. Alvarez and two accomplices, all wearing police uniforms, confronted the homeowner in his garage, drawing pistols and shouting that they were the police. They then bound the homeowner, his wife, and his teenage son at gunpoint, and took approximately $6,000 in cash and other valuables.  \u2022 A home invasion in Colleyville on January 26, 2017. Alvarez and his accomplices knocked on the house\u2019s front door, announcing that they were U.S. Marshals. When the victim opened the door, they forced their way into the home at gunpoint, placed the victim in handcuffs, and took jewelry, clothing, a pistol, and an automobile.  \u2022 A home invasion in Duncanville on May 1, 2017. Alvarez and an accomplice confronted the homeowner in his garage at gunpoint and handcuffed him. The two robbers brought the homeowner inside his home and when the homeowner\u2014believing that they were police officers\u2014asked to see the search warrant, one of the robbers struck him twice in the head with a pistol. The pair then took jewelry, approximately $10,000 in cash, and a pistol from the victim.

The ready-to-eat convenience factor is hard to top, as well. Snack on them right out of the bag, dip them in hummus or guacamole, or -- for a bit of added crunch and bright orange color -- chop them up and add them to salads or salsas.

In one study, people who ate one grapefruit a day lowered their bad (LDL) cholesterol by 15.5% and their triglycerides by 27%. In another, eating half a grapefruit -- roughly 40 calories -- before each meal helped dieters lose about 3\u00bd pounds over 12 weeks.

But its nutritional profile -- lots of fiber, potassium, vitamin A and vitamin C -- is slightly more impressive. What's more, broccoli is the only cruciferous vegetable (a category that contains cabbage and kale, in addition to cauliflower) with a significant amount of sulforaphane, a potent compound that boosts the body's protective enzymes and flushes out cancer-causing chemicals.

Raspberries and blueberries both hover around 85% water, and blackberries are only slightly better at 88.2%.\"I love strawberries blended in a smoothie or mixed with plain nonfat yogurt, another hydrating food,\" Gans says. Strawberries add natural sweetness to the yogurt, she adds, and the combo of carbohydrates, fiber and protein make a great post-workout recovery snack.  Star fruit Water content: 91.4% This tropical fruit, also known as carambola, comes in sweet and tart varieties and has a juicy texture similar to pineapple. Its eye-catching shape looks great in a fruit salad or as an edible garnish on the rim of a summer cocktail. As a bonus, it's rich in antioxidants, especially epicatechin, a heart-healthy compound also found in red wine, dark chocolate and green tea. One note of caution: People with kidney problems should avoid star fruit because of its high levels of oxalic acid.

Water content: 91.4%Iceberg lettuce may have a higher water content, but spinach is usually a better bet overall. Piling raw spinach leaves on your sandwich or salad provides nearly as much built-in hydration, with an added nutritional punch.Spinach is rich in lutein, potassium, fiber and brain-boosting folate, and just one cup of raw leaves contains 15% of your daily intake of vitamin E, an important antioxidant for fighting off the damaging molecules known as free radicals.  Watermelon Water content: 91.5% It's fairly obvious that watermelon is full of, well, water, but this juicy melon is also among the richest sources of lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant found in red fruits and vegetables. In fact, watermelon contains more lycopene than raw tomatoes: about 12 milligrams per wedge, versus 3 milligrams per medium tomato. Although this melon is plenty hydrating on its own, Gans loves to mix it with water in the summertime. \"Keep a water pitcher in the fridge with watermelon cubes in the bottom,\" she says. \"It's really refreshing and a great incentive to drink more water overall.\"  Watermelon Water content: 91.5% It's fairly obvious that watermelon is full of, well, water, but this juicy melon is also among the richest sources of lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant found in red fruits and vegetables.

And contrary to popular belief, green peppers contain just as many antioxidants as their slightly sweeter siblings.

Radishes Water content: 95.3% These refreshing root vegetables should be a fixture in your spring and summer salads. They provide a burst of spicy-sweet flavor -- and color! -- in a small package, and more important, they're filled with antioxidants such as catechin (also found in green tea). A crunchy texture also makes radishes a perfect addition to healthy summer coleslaw, with no mayo required. Slice them up with shredded cabbage and carrots, sliced snow peas, and chopped hazelnuts and parsley, and toss with poppy seeds, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper.

Like all foods that are high in water, celery has very few calories: just 6 calories per stalk. And its one-two punch of fiber and water helps fill you up and curb your appetite.This lightweight veggie isn't short on nutrition, however. Celery contains folate and vitamins A, C and K. And thanks in part to its high water content, celery neutralizes stomach acid and is often recommended as a natural remedy for heartburn and acid reflux.  Water content: 95.6%Iceberg lettuce tends to get a bad rap, nutrition-wise. Health experts often recommend shunning it in favor of darker greens like spinach or romaine lettuce, which contain higher amounts of fiber and nutrients such as folate and vitamin K.It's a different story when it comes to water content, though: Crispy iceberg has the highest of any lettuce, followed by butterhead, green leaf and romaine varieties.So when the temperature rises, pile iceberg onto sandwiches or use it as a bed for a healthy chicken salad . Even better: Ditch the tortillas and hamburger buns and use iceberg leaves as a wrap for tacos and burgers.  Water content: 96.7%This summer veggie -- which has the highest water content of any solid food -- is perfect in salads or sliced up and served with some hummus, says Keri Gans, author of \"The Small Change Diet: 10 Steps to a Thinner and Healthier You\" and a consultant to Mindbloom, a technology company that makes life-improvement apps.Want to pump up cucumber's hydrating power even more? Try blending it with nonfat yogurt, mint and ice cubes to make cucumber soup.  According to the old rule of thumb, you're supposed to drink eight glasses of water per day (and some experts recommend even more). That can seem like a daunting task on some days, but here's the catch: You don't have to drink all that water. Roughly 20% of our daily H2O intake comes from solid foods, especially fruits and vegetables. It's still important to drink plenty of water -- especially in the summertime -- but you can also quench your thirst with these 15 hugely hydrating foods, all of which are at least 90% water by weight.

It's still important to drink plenty of water -- especially in the summertime -- but you can also quench your thirst with these 15 hugely hydrating foods, all of which are at least 90% water by weight.  Sure, you can always reach for a glass of water -- but plain H20 isn't the most hydrating beverage around, according to a study from Scotland's St. Andrews University that compared the hydration responses of several different drinks.  The researchers found that while water -- both still and sparkling --does a pretty good job of quickly hydrating the body, beverages with a little bit of sugar, fat or protein do an even better job of keeping us hydrated for longer.  The reason has to do with how our bodies respond to beverages, according to Ronald Maughan, a professor at St. Andrews' School of Medicine and the study's author. One factor is the volume of a given drink: The more you drink, the faster the drink empties from your stomach and gets absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can dilute the body's fluids and hydrate you.  The other factor affecting how well a beverage hydrates relates to a drink's nutrient composition. For example, milk was found to be even more hydrating than plain water because it contains the sugar lactose, some protein and some fat, all of which help to slow the emptying of fluid from the stomach and keep hydration happening over a longer period of time.  Milk also has sodium, which acts like a sponge and holds onto water in the body and results in less urine produced.  The same can be said for oral rehydration solutions that are used to treat diarrhea. Those contain small amounts of sugar, as well as sodium and potassium, which can also help promote water retention in the body.  The most hydrating beverages, ranked The research team at St. Andrews University tested 13 common beverages to see how they impact hydration. Here's what they found, ranked from most hydrating over a four-hour period to least. Skim milk  Oral rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte or Liquid I.V.)  Full fat milk  Orange juice  Cola  Diet Cola  Cold tea  Tea  Sports drink  Still water  Sparkling water  Lager  Coffee Source: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 103, Issue 3, March 2016, Pages 717--723  \"This study tells us much of what we already knew: Electrolytes -- like sodium and potassium -- contribute to better hydration, while calories in beverages result in slower gastric emptying and therefore slower release of urination,\" said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian, personal trainer and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who was not involved in the study.  Sugar in moderation  But here's where it gets tricky: Beverages with more concentrated sugars, such as fruit juices or colas, are not necessarily as hydrating as their lower-sugar cousins. They may spend a little more time in the stomach and empty more slowly compared to plain water, but once these beverages enter the small intestine their high concentration of sugars gets diluted during a physiological process called osmosis. This process in effect \"pulls\" water from the body into the small intestine to dilute the sugars these beverages contain. And technically, anything inside the intestine is outside your body.  Juice and soda are not only less hydrating, but offer extra sugars and calories that won't fill us up as much as solid foods, explained Majumdar. If the choice is between soda and water for hydration, go with water every time. After all, our kidneys and liver depend on water to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and water also plays a key role in maintaining skin's elasticity and suppleness. It's the cheapest moisturizer you'll find.  While staying hydrated is important -- doing so keeps our joints lubricated, helps prevent infections, and carries nutrients to our cells -- in most situations people don't need to worry too much about how hydrating their beverages are.  \"If you're thirsty, your body will tell you to drink more,\" Maughan said. But for athletes training seriously in warm conditions with high sweat losses, or for someone whose cognitive function may be negatively impacted by working long hours without beverage breaks, hydration becomes a critical issue.  Can beer and lattes keep me hydrated?  Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which causes you to pass more urine, so when it comes to alcoholic beverages hydration will depend on a beverage's total volume. \"Beer would result in less water loss than whiskey, because you are ingesting more fluid with beer,\" Maughan said. \"Strong alcoholic drinks will dehydrate, dilute alcoholic drinks will not.\"  When it comes to coffee, how well your java hydrates you will depend on the amount of caffeine you consume. A regular coffee with about 80 milligrams of caffeine -- roughly what you would find in 12 oz. of Folgers' house blen d -- would be pretty much as hydrating as water, according to Maughan's research.", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-25T16:18:01", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/uhrXBGkg0KE/man-gets-heart-shocked-34-times-vpx.wews", "title": "Man gets heart shocked an astounding 34 times", "text": "An Ohio man who nearly died after suffering a heart attack is now sharing his near-death experience after getting shocked back to life.", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-25T22:42:49", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/nop8EL9BrbY/index.html", "title": "Here's how to protect yourself (and your pets) from EEE, the deadly mosquito-borne virus", "text": "It's the fourth Massachusetts resident to die from EEE, which can cause brain swelling, in 2019. Previous deaths occurred in Connecticut, Michigan and Rhode Island.  This year's EEE outbreak has been particularly severe, with 27 human cases of the virus in six states since August.  Several animals, mostly horses and goats, have gotten the virus, too. A Mexican gray wolf pup died at a Michigan zoo last week after an EEE diagnosis, though officials said it was rare for canines to contract the illness.  If local health officials have issued EEE warnings for your county, don't panic. Here's how to keep your family, including its furrier members, safe from the virus.  Go heavy on the repellent  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends EPA-approved mosquito repellents, particularly those that contain DEET, a powerful active ingredient in many repellents, or the oil of lemon eucalyptus.  Luckily, it's quite rare for domestic animals like cats and dogs to be diagnosed with EEE (it's named for its prevalence in horses, after all). It's still possible though, so ask your veterinarian for a repellent approved for animal use.  Unless you have a stable of horses, you can't get an EEE vaccine. The only EEE shot is made exclusively for equines.  Stay indoors between dusk and dawn  As the days grow shorter, it gets increasingly difficult to beat the sunset. But Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor and expert in mosquito-borne illnesses, encourages people to try : Mosquitoes are most active in the dark, so it's best to stay indoors then and avoid them entirely.  Try telling that to a pet that urgently needs to use the restroom. If an animal needs to relieve itself or play outside at night, it's best to keep them on a deck or patio that's screened in -- it keeps mosquitoes out.  But mosquitoes can still strike while the sun's up. The pests are attracted to shade, he said, so be aware of any buzzing while you retreat from the heat.  If you want to sit on your porch past sundown, Telford suggests firing up a powerful fan or two -- he says mosquitoes can't fly against the wind. The same goes for any barns where larger animals like horses or alpaca are kept.  Sleep under a mosquito net  If you're sleeping outside or in a room without screens, consider sleeping under a mosquito net.  The CDC recommends nets that follow the World Health Organization's criteria: white, rectangular, with 156 holes per square inch. Nets treated with permethrin, an insecticide, are most effective.  Wear long sleeves and pants  In much of the country, it's still quite hot. But the CDC suggests covering up exposed skin on the arms and legs so infected mosquitoes can't bite it.  For extra coverage, spray permethrin on clothes, socks and shoes or buy pre-treated clothing. But use caution if you do it yourself, because permethrin shouldn't be applied directly on the skin.  Empty out stagnant water  Any pools of standing water, whether in a bird bath, an old tire or a puddle, are prime breeding spots for mosquitoes. So be sure to empty them out -- particularly in areas your pets frequent.  The CDC also encourages scrubbing mosquito-friendly spots, including buckets and trash cans, at least once a week for good measure to make sure any mosquito eggs don't hatch.", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2018-03-13T21:23:01", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/M07-mXfUeK0/index.html", "title": "Is there such a thing as 'good porn'?", "text": "Story highlights Free pornography makes porn more accessible and more acceptable to us  But with this growing acceptance comes a tolerance for mediocre material  The ethical porn trend is changing the way erotic content is both and consumed  (CNN) For many of us, our first exposure to pornography was surreptitious: a sneak peek at someone else's copy of Playboy or the viewing of a worn VHS tape stolen from an older sibling.  Today, however, porn is everywhere; anyone can jump online and view it with the few clicks of a keyboard. The numbers are staggering: According to data provided by the American Psychological Association, rates of porn consumption range between 50% and 99% among men and 30% to 86% among women.  The popular website PornHub alone logs about 2.4 million visitors per hour -- more than an estimated 6,000 visitors per second.  And guess what? It's all free.

Porn -- or, as we call it in my field, sexually explicit Internet material or visual sexual stimuli -- can be a valuable aspect of a healthy sex life.  A proposed regulation in California would require porn actors to wear condoms while filming.

As the only pulmonologist on duty that Fourth of July holiday week, D'Andrea noticed those alarming cases followed on the heels of another teen who had a non-infectious condition with matching symptoms.  \" 'We need to be thinking about something else,' \" she told Dr. Michael Meyer, medical director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, as he later recounted.  That \"thinking about something else\" led to the discovery of at least 530 probable vaping-related injury cases in 38 states, a U.S. territory and Canada. At least nine people have died. While the exact cause of the illness remains unclear, President Donald Trump is considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and Walmart has taken them off its shelves altogether.  The epidemic has prompted outrage about federal oversight of vaping, but there is also a local public health success story to be told. Doctors and regional officials in Wisconsin, Illinois and elsewhere pieced together that this mysterious illness was much larger than it appeared. It's a tale of teamwork, communication and long-serving public health officials tapping into their networks in an era of limited public health funding, diminished public health infrastructure and high turnover.  It's surprising in some ways that Wisconsin became ground zero for uncovering the link. The state has ranked near the bottom nationwide for per-person spending on public health until a huge boost of $588 million more was greenlighted for the next two years. Wisconsin is also home to Juul vaping pod manufacturing sites, and one of its U.S. senators, Republican Ron Johnson, credits his win to vaping advocates.  And yet the state's officials discovered the outbreak, which shows no signs of stopping.  \"I don't think anyone could have anticipated how wide-reaching this problem has become,\" D'Andrea said in an email.  Discovering the vaping link  Although isolated cases of vaping-related respiratory problems were spotted elsewhere, including as early as 2015 in West Virginia, a new wave of cases began popping up across the country starting in mid-April.  Otherwise healthy patients, many of them teenagers, complained of shortness of breath. unexplained weight loss, fatigue and gastrointestinal issues. They were often diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome \u2014 essentially a lung injury from an unknown cause. The cases baffled health providers nationwide.  In North Carolina, clinicians puzzled over how healthy teenagers could suddenly be so ill that they needed ventilators for something that wasn't infectious, said Zack Moore, the state's epidemiology chief.  But in Wisconsin, doctors from Children's Hospital used extensive patient histories to piece together the missing link among that cluster of four cases: vaping.  This is no easy feat when dealing with teenagers who may not want to admit to vaping in front of their parents \u2014 especially when it comes to vaping THC oil, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana. But for D'Andrea, a 25-year veteran who specializes in breathing issues among children and leads the hospital's pulmonary team, the patients' openness is part of what made the discovery possible.  \"They were part of the 'team' who was trying to help us figure this out,\" she said.  After discussing the cases with Meyer and other colleagues, D'Andrea called Dr. Michael Gutzeit, the hospital's chief medical officer, on July 8. That phone call raised the warning from within Children's Hospital to the local health department, then to the state health department and eventually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta \u2014 effectively putting this health crisis on the nation's radar.  \"It's incredible that they saw this,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Gotts, a pulmonologist at the University of California-San Francisco. \"As front-line clinicians, there are very few things that we would report to public health authorities in the ICU. It's not that unusual to have people show up with respiratory failure.\"  From local to state  Because the four patients with these symptoms at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin were from Waukesha County just outside Milwaukee, infection specialists from the hospital gave the local health department a call.  Shortly thereafter, Waukesha's public health officer, Ben Jones, reached out to the state's respiratory disease epidemiologist, Thomas Haupt, whom he'd known for 15 years.  \"They didn't know how vaping would be involved\" with these mysterious cases, said Haupt, a 34-year veteran of the Department of Health Services. \"They called me right away.\"  Haupt was immediately alarmed. He put down the phone and marched to the office of Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Meiman, on July 10, interrupting a meeting.  \"We need to talk about this,\" he recalled saying.  At that point, both the hospital and Haupt knew only that this was a local problem \u2014 and one that was getting worse. \"It went from four cases to eight,\" Haupt said. The team retroactively realized they had treated a patient admitted June 11 with similar symptoms, and had three more come in by July 19.  Haupt went to work notifying fellow public health officials across state lines in case this mysterious illness reached beyond Wisconsin, emailing two groups. Twelve years ago, he had set up a Midwest Influenza Coordinators Group, composed of officials from 11 states in the region to better manage flu season. He also helped lead the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.  \"Communication is always the biggest asset you've got as far as any disease investigation,\" Haupt said.  It didn't hurt that most of the people on these emails had run in the same public health circles for years. Several wrote back that they'd check things out with their poison control centers and public health departments.  In the meantime, the state health department and Children's Hospital coordinated a press announcement and clinicians' alert on July 25. Communication and trust was easy \u2014 Meiman and Gutzeit had worked together previously on Ebola preparedness efforts a few years earlier.  The news conference was livestreamed on Facebook. Following the briefing that day, another set of Wisconsin parents took a teenager with similar symptoms to the hospital.  The case in Illinois  Within days, a clinician in Illinois who had seen the coverage called the Wisconsin state health department worried that a patient in Illinois might have the same condition. That's when Meiman called his Illinois counterpart, Dr. Jennifer Layden, to let her know her state might have the mysterious illness, too.  \"We started calling health departments and hospitals to see if others had this very vague description,\" Layden said. \"In a couple of days, just by those calls, we had two other patients.\"  In San Francisco, Dr. Elizabeth Gibb saw a patient whose mom had seen the news out of Wisconsin and asked if it might be connected to her hospitalized teenager.  By Aug. 2, Illinois had put out a clinicians' alert looking for more cases. Wisconsin was up to 11 cases.  As more cases appeared across the country, Wisconsin drafted a questionnaire for states to send out to clinicians, so they could all have a similar case definition and work off of similar data, Haupt said. At least 20 people in the Wisconsin state health department hustled on the response \u2014 on top of their regular workload.  The Epi-X tipping point  Following the news of a case across the border in Illinois \u2014 and one month since that first phone call from D'Andrea to Gutzeit \u2014 the Wisconsin health department decided to send out an Epi-X alert on Aug. 8. That's an alert to all state health departments on the Epidemic Information Exchange network run by the CDC.  After the bulletin announcing Wisconsin had up to 25 suspected cases linked to vaping, calls poured in from New Jersey to North Carolina.  From there, it started to snowball.  The CDC announced on Aug. 17 that 94 possible cases existed, kicking off a media frenzy that culminated in national awareness of the dangers of vaping and cries for the head of the Food and Drug Administration to resign.  Within days, the CDC dispatched a team \u2014 two people to Illinois, two to Wisconsin \u2014 that helped comb through cases. Meiman and Layden continued to work together to further define the condition and coordinate information from other states.

As the caseload has quintupled, much still remains unknown about the illness. Many experts don't believe this outbreak will end anytime soon. Still, Haupt said he's incredibly proud of the work the officials in Wisconsin \u2014 from Children's Hospital to the state health department \u2014 did spotting it. He believes their notification may have helped save lives.  \"That's the way public health is supposed to work,\" he said. \"And trust me, it doesn't always work that way.\"", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-24T17:48:49", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/5e1LJ--CCsM/index.html", "title": "A new 'report card' on America's diet: It's not an 'F' but...", "text": "(CNN) Are you a glass half-full sort of person? Well, then, get ready for some good news. You and your fellow Americans are doing a better job of eliminating crummy carbs and sugar from your diet.  That's the takeaway from a new \"report card\" on the American diet, which found that since 1999 we are eating nearly 3% fewer highly processed foods with added sugars. The study, published Tuesday in JAMA, analyzed the eating habits of nearly 44,000 adults between the years of 1999 and 2016.  \"These positive trends are likely to reflect an increased public awareness of the health risks associated with high added sugar and low whole grain consumption,\" said study co-author Fang Fang Zhang, an associate professor at Tuft's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.  Now drink down that glass of water, because the complete picture is not that rosy. We're still eating way too much of what's not healthy. In fact, 42% of a typical American's daily calories came from refined grains, starchy veggies and added sugars.

There are more than 15,000 manuscripts published about curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, and about 50 manuscripts added to this collection each week, according to the National Institutes of Health  \"It's really taken on sort of panacea-like properties in terms of the things it's being studied for and the things it has been reported to be useful for,\" said D. Craig Hopp, deputy director of the Division of Extramural Research at the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  What is turmeric?  Turmeric is a popular spice similar to ginger, known for its bright yellow color and use in curry powders and mustards. Also called \"Indian saffron,\" the plant grows across India, other areas of Asia and Central America. Turmeric flavors a range of dishes, is a vital component of certain religious rituals and has been used for medicinal purposes for nearly 4,000 years  \"There are plenty of studies currently being done but already good evidence that turmeric can help control knee pain from arthritis as well as decrease the likelihood of a heart attack after bypass surgery,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent.  Turmeric is one of many plants used in ayurveda, a traditional South Asian system of medicine, according to the National Institutes of Health. It is used to treat issues such as breathing problems, rheumatism, fatigue and pain.  \"There's a distinction that's very important to make between turmeric, which is the plant and the spice, and what people often study, which is the curcumin, which is the proposed active constituent in turmeric,\" Hopp said. \"And even curcumin, as it's usually sold or researched, is not a single compound. It's usually a collection of three or four compounds that are called curcuminoids, collectively.\"  The exact amount varies, but the turmeric root contains up to 5% of these curcuminoids typically, the National Institutes of Health says.  A gap between theory and practice  Extracting the curcumin and translating its power into a successful treatment is still a major challenge for researchers, experts say. There is epidemiologic evidence that people who eat a diet rich in turmeric can potentially attribute their substantial health benefits to the spice, Hopp said, citing a lower incidence of colon cancer in the Indian subcontinent.  \"But it's very difficult to sort of project what you see in terms of an activity in a cell to what's going to actually happen in the human,\" he added. \"There's a sort of a disconnect between what appears to be a lot of very promising activity in vitro, which is just in the cells. And contrast that with where it's been studied in clinical trials as humans, where there's been virtually no evidence of benefits.\"  One reason for that disconnect is that apart from turmeric, curcumin has biological properties that make it poorly bioavailable: It is rapidly metabolized and excreted, and very little of it gets absorbed into the body. The chemical doesn't make it to the places where it could be of help.  The context in which turmeric is traditionally used is important as well, Hopp said. Black pepper is often found alongside turmeric. Piperine , the substance that gives pepper its bite, increases curcumin's bioavailability.  \"It keeps the door open,\" Hopp said. \"As things go into and out of cells, piperine is sort of like a doorstop that allows things to go in and out of the cells much more readily.\"  Photos: 12 healthy herbs and spices: A closer look Our ancestors used herbs and spices to flavor foods and soon learned that some of them seemed to improve their health.

One would need to take as many as 24 500-milligram tablets of curcumin a day to get an effective dose, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.  \"If you think about it, in a curry, there's only 700 milligrams of turmeric,\" said Dr. Francesca Cordeiro, professor of ophthalmology at Imperial College London and one of the authors of the study. \"You'd need to eat 200 curries a day to get that therapeutic level.\"  Instead of choosing capsules or cuisine as their method of treatment delivery, Cordeiro's team used eye drops infused with a stabilizer that increased the curcumin's solubility on their rat subjects twice a day.  \"We used nanotechnology,\" Cordeiro said. \"The advantage of it being so small is it can cross into the eye as an eye drop into the back of the eye. Once it enters, it can affect the nerve cells there, and that direct effect can lead to them not dying. It's what we call neuroprotection.\"  Three weeks later, the untreated control group had a 23% reduction in retinal cells compared with the eye drop group. This loss was prevented by treatment with curcumin, Cordeiro explained.  The researchers' next steps include clinical trials and exploring the possibility of using the retina as a \"window to the brain\" by developing the drops into a diagnostic resource for Alzheimer's disease.

That might make you wonder: Does wearing sunscreen interfere with vitamin D levels and potentially cause vitamin D deficiency?  The short answer is yes. But before you toss your SPF 30, dermatologists say the relationship between sunscreen and vitamin D is much more nuanced than that.  According to Dr. Henry W. Lim, chair emeritus of the department of dermatology at the Henry Ford Health System and former president of the American Academy of Dermatology, if sunscreen is supplied in a thick layer it \"can effectively block sunlight and cause a lack of vitamin D synthesis in skin,\" Lim said. A thick layer is defined as roughly equivalent to about 1 ounce, or the size of one golf ball, for the full body, he said.  \"However, in the real world ... most people apply less than this amount,\" Lim added. In other words, \"the 'in use' SPF is actually lower than the labeled SPF.\"  So, you may not have to worry about vitamin D deficiency if you're not putting enough sunscreen on in the first place.

The stresses of today's fast-paced society combined with a national epidemic of sleep deprivation can turn anyone temporarily toxic.  That's ok if it's not a habit, experts say. It's frequent boorish behavior that can become contagious.  \"Bad behavior is actually more contagious than good behavior,\" said Robert Sutton , author of \" The A--hole Survival Guide : How to Deal With People Who Treat You Like Dirt.\"  \"So if you walk into a situation where there's a bunch of disrespect, it's hard not to catch that behavior,\" said Sutton, a professor of management science at the Stanford University School of Engineering.  But turning from Jekyll to Hyde occasionally does not make a person a bully. What does define a person as a true bully, Sutton says, is if they regularly make you feel \"oppressed, humiliated, de-energized or belittled.\"  The brutish actions that often lead to those feelings, Sutton said, include personal insults, teasing jokes, threats, public shaming, rude interruptions, invasion of personal space or uninvited personal contact.  Types of bullies  Tangible/material bully  These bullies use their formal power, such as being a boss or executive at a company, or material power, such as having legal authority or control over finances, to intimidate others.  Power is a dangerous thing, Sutton said. \"If you're an a-hole and a winner, you are still a loser as a human being in my book.\"  Verbal bully  This type of bully shames and insults with words, often expressing constant criticism or using hostile teasing, Ni explained. Sometimes the language can be sexist, racist or homophobic, and can be threatening.  Passive-aggressive bully  It might not sound like bullying, said Ni, but in some ways, this method is the most cunning. This type of jerk behaves nicely on the surface, but stings subtly.  Examples include toxic gossip, jokes and sarcasm at their victim's expense. A passive bully can roll their eyes, make rude facial gestures and ridicule their target by mimicking some small action. They can also socially or professionally isolate their prey, thus causing insecurity and anxiety.  Cyber bully  A huge problem today, cyberbullying can have lethal consequences for the young and vulnerable. Even mature and emotionally stable adults can be victims of harassing texts, emails and social media. Identity theft is another way of cyberbullying, Ni says.  Physical bully  This can range from simulating violence by raising a fist as if to strike, to throwing objects, to violent acts of physical, sexual and domestic abuse.  How to survive an adult bully  For many adult bullies, the journey begins in a troubled home.  \"Certainly, there's things like upbringing,\" Sutton said. \"Perhaps they had role models around them who treated others with disrespect and advised that to get ahead in life you should crush others and treat them like dirt.\"  Research at Duke University shows that adults who bully often have had troubled childhoods and can be victims of abuse or bullying themselves. They also suffer the worst outcomes as adults. They are much more likely to suffer from a serious illness or psychiatric disorder, abuse drugs or be convicted of felonies. If they were chronically bullied, they are likely to be more isolated, less educated and poorer.  \"There's this saying: Some people want to feel tall by cutting off the heads of others,\" said Ni. \"Many bullies actually don't feel very good about themselves, and the only way for them to feel good about themselves is to put others down.\"  Flip your point of view  So, does that mean we should feel sorry for some bullies? As long as the bullying is not violent or threatening, you might consider it, Ni said, but not for the sake of the bully. It can actually help you cope.  \"I think one of the smartest keys to learning how to deal with bullies, especially if this is somebody who you interact with on a more or less regular basis, is to consider this person's background,\" Ni said. \"And if you know the person came from a traumatic family environment, showing some empathy and understanding in no way excuses the bullying behavior, but it reduces the intimidation factor.\"  When you stop thinking of the bully as a scary person, you stop reacting in a flight-or-fight manner, Ni said, and can be wiser in devising assertive ways of handling the situation.  Pick your battles  Deciding on how to react depends a lot on the frequency and severity of the bullying behavior. If the behavior is not excessive or harmful and you only see the bully on occasion at work, or the obnoxious relative once a year at family reunions, then Ni suggests keeping your distance. As soon as you're done with the task at hand, disengage and stay out of that person's line of sight.  \"We're always looking to right wrongs in every single situation,\" Ni said. \"But it does take time and effort to handle bullying behavior in many cases. So, if it's not directly harmful, if it's infrequent, consider picking your battles. Engage, then disengage.\"  Try some Jedi mind tricks  Jedis used the Force to implant suggestions in the minds of others to bend them to their will. Sutton suggests applying those tricks to your own mind as well as that of the bully.  For example, if the bullying is not affecting your personal safety or livelihood, Sutton suggests trying to see the humor in it (sort of like picturing all those people in the audience naked to get over stage fright). Or you might try being overly nice to the bully.  \"Sometimes you just have to rise above it and kill them with kindness,\" he said.  You can also try to look the bully in the eyes while they are being a jerk.  \"You have much less empathy for human beings when you don't see their face and don't see their eyes,\" Sutton said. \"When you don't have eye contact with someone, you're much more likely to be nasty, and so it turns out eye contact can be very important.\"  Coping with a chronic, toxic bully  What if you're dealing with a chronic bully and it is completely disrupting your ability to enjoy your home or work? Then it's time to bring out the bigger guns.  Make a clean getaway  Sutton's first rule of surviving a toxic bully is escape, if you can. See if you can move your desk far away from the offender, or restrict your interactions with a toxic neighbor or avoid that unbelievably irritating soccer mom and dad. If that fails, try again. Can you find another soccer league? Can you move to another role in the organization?  Document every detail  Both Ni and Sutton say the most important thing you can do if you find yourself in an untenable situation with a chronic bully is to document the behavior. If this is at work, start by checking your company's anti-harassment policies. They may have specific guidelines on how to report the bully's behavior.  Write down exactly what happened when you get back to your desk, including exact quotes if possible. Were there any witnesses -- even passers-by? Write down their names and if you are comfortable, ask them to document what they saw or heard. Add the time, location and any circumstances that led to the behavior. Do it every time the harassment happens and build a file.  Are there any emails, voice messages or other evidence that can help build your case? Collect it immediately and create a formal way to archive it until you're ready to act. Be as professional as possible in your presentation of the events.  But be careful about taping the encounter with audio or video. Each state has different laws, with some being \"two-party\" states -- which means you must have the permission of both the person being recorded and the recorder. Audiotape or videotape someone in one of those states and try to use it and you could be facing a lawsuit.  Documentation is effective outside of work too. Ni tells a story of a neighbor who smoked so often in close proximity to Ni's house that the vapors entered his home. After numerous requests to get the person to stop their behavior failed, he began collecting bills for drape and rug cleaning and presented those to the neighbor, and suggested that if he didn't pay he'd be contacting a lawyer.  \"He hasn't smoked near my home for three years now,\" Ni said.  Get a posse  \"Most bullies, most chronic bullies, pick on more than one person,\" said Ni, who coaches clients and counsels Fortune 500 companies. \"When victims are willing to band together it helps because there is strength in numbers.\"  Fellow victims can help you document any abuse, share their own experiences, and convince management or the local condo association that the bully's behavior is real and has to stop. That puts you in a greater position of power, and when you have that, said Ni, the bully will back off.  \"Most bullies are cowards on the inside,\" Ni said. \"They find weaker people to pick on because they know they can get away with it. I would say nine times out of 10 when you confront a bully from a position of strength, they back off right away.  \"This has been my experience a great many times,\" Ni said, \"both in dealing with aggressive people myself as well as helping my clients or my students deal with bullies.\"  Sutton agrees. \"When people fight back alone, it doesn't work very well, but the bigger the posse, the more power and safety they have in the situation,\" he says. \"The successful efforts against everything from abusive Catholic priests to Harvey Weinstein are good examples.\"", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-20T10:26:21", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/mIMrTE59GMA/index.html", "title": "The thousands of fetal remains found in a doctor's Illinois garage date to 2000, authorities say", "text": "(CNN) The 2,246 fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer this month are from abortions he performed between 2000 and 2002, when he operated clinics in Indiana, authorities said.

But only if you register with the police", "text": "CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals , an ongoing series.  Due to the stigma associated with sex work in Senegal, the women CNN interviewed asked that their identities be protected. They are identified using pseudonyms.  Dakar, Senegal \u2014 On a sweltering afternoon in a suburb of Dakar, Binta is among a group of women waiting to be seen in the back of a Senegalese government clinic. When her name is called, she is ushered into a check-up room, tested for a series of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and handed free condoms.  At the end of the appointment, the nurse stamps her identification card, called a \"carnet sanitaire,\" which she is required to carry as a registered, legal sex worker.  The 24-year-old single mother travels over an hour and a half by taxi to get here, even though it means she's sometimes late for her evening computer science classes. On the ride through Dakar's traffic-snarled streets, she flips through photos of her 4-year-old son on her phone. For Binta, it's worth the long commute: \"I go here because it's discreet.\"  Binta travels in a taxi after her appointment at the S\u00e9bikhotane clinic  She first came to S\u00e9bikhotane clinic last fall, after signing up to a government scheme that regulates the sex industry in Senegal. Under the program, sex workers must register with police, attend mandatory monthly sexual health screenings, test negative for STIs and carry a valid ID card confirming their health status. If a sex worker contracts HIV, they're given free antiretroviral therapy treatment before being allowed to continue soliciting clients.  Binta didn't think twice about joining the program, convinced that it would help safeguard her from sexually transmitted diseases and abuse.  Senegal's legalization and regulation of sex work has been applauded for controlling the nation's HIV rate. At 0.4% , HIV prevalence in the country is significantly lower than many of its West and Central African neighbors; the average for the region is 1.5%, per UNAIDS. That figure is even higher in East and Southern Africa, where HIV prevalence is 7.1%.  It's also the only nation on the continent where sex work is legal and regulated by health policy, according to the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) , which advocates for decriminalization of the profession.  Some public health experts suggest that Senegal's registration system opened dialogue about sexual behavior and laid the groundwork for future HIV prevention programs targeting vulnerable populations.  An exterior view of the clinic in S\u00e9bikhotane  But questions remain about the policy's efficacy in controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Sex work is still criminalized in Senegal for those who are unregistered, which effectively creates a two-tiered system in which \"clandestine\" prostitutes fall through the cracks.  And signing up for the legal scheme is not such a simple choice in Senegal, a 96% Muslim-majority nation where sex workers face enormous social stigma and discrimination. NSWP says that leaves sex workers open to exploitation by police. Plus, the system only applies to women over 21, leaving male sex workers without support (homosexuality is illegal under Senegalese law).  These factors combined are cited by researchers to explain the low level of registration -- only 20% of sex workers across Senegal and 43% in Dakar have signed up to get the card.  \"Right now, the system doesn't work,\" says Khady Gueye, program coordinator for the HIV division of Senegal's Ministry of Health, who provides support to both registered and unregistered women through outreach programs.  Khady Gueye gestures after a meeting with clandestine sex workers in Dakar  Senegal's Ministry of Health and civil society groups are hoping to change that, particularly because sex workers are still the main contributor to the HIV epidemic: with a prevalence of 6.6%, they are up to 16 times more likely to be infected than the general population.  'The problem is the card'  Although the registration law was first introduced in 1969 -- inherited from French colonial legislation that stuck around even after Senegal declared independence -- there was little evidence of its impact on sex workers until recently.  AIDS and STI division of Senegal's Ministry of Health, which revealed that the registration system has a crippling impact on sex worker's mental well-being. Aurelia Lepine, a development economist at University College London, published a report last year in collaboration with Professor Cheikh Tidiane Ndour, director of theAIDS and STI divisionof Senegal's Ministry of Health, which revealed that the registration system has a crippling impact on sex worker's mental well-being.  A midwife at the clinic in the Dakar suburb of S\u00e9bikhotane prepares medical equipment to examine a registered sex worker  \"In Senegal, there is this idea ... that the low HIV rate is due to this policy,\" said Lepine, explaining that this was part of the reason she wanted to study the system. But while she found registration led to a 38% decrease in STI prevalence, it also dramatically reduced the well-being of sex workers.  \"It's a good policy in terms of public health. The problem is the card. So, it's not the policy itself, but it's the way it is materialized,\" Lepine said.  Women who are registered live in fear that family members will discover their identification cards, or somehow see their name on a registration database. To avoid detection, they go out of their way to visit remote health clinics like S\u00e9bikhotane.  Awa, a 28-year-old registered sex worker who spoke with CNN after her appointment at the clinic, worries constantly that her 11-year-old son will find her ID.  \"At home I made a little hole in my mattress where I hide the card, because my son is old enough to understand,\" Awa said, wiping away tears. \"Registering has helped me on one side because I never have any health issues, and when I need medication I can get it. But in other ways it doesn't help at all.\"  Chief midwife Penda Ba returns Awa's ID card following her mandatory check-up  In her report, Lepine suggests that the card could be replaced by a mobile application to track appointments, or with a quick response (QR) code issued at each medical visit. She recently received a grant from the UK Medical Research Council to explore these alternatives with the Ministry of Health.  Registered for life  Over ataya tea in his office at Dakar's Polyclinique hospital, Ndour said it would be difficult to change the card, but acknowledged that the current system was problematic.  \"When you are registered, you are registered for life,\" said Ndour, referring to the database of registered sex workers, which is easily available to police forces and healthcare workers. \"That, I think, needs to change. The duration. There is no limitation, and somewhere, even if you stop pursuing this profession, your great-grandchildren can find your name somewhere, and that is a problem.\"  \"This opens the door to certain infringements,\" Ndour added, explaining that exploitation of sex workers by police forces is alleged to take place in some parts of the country.  Professor Cheikh Tidiane Ndour at his office in Dakar's Polyclinique hospital  The Director-General of Senegal's National Police did not respond to CNN's request for comment.  If registered sex workers miss their monthly appointments they can face up to six months in jail, Lepine found in her research, which puts police officers in a position to abuse their power.  The study found that registered sex workers were more likely than unregistered prostitutes to experience violence at the hands of police officers.  \"We heard stories from women who were telling us that because a policeman knew she was a sex worker, they will go to their place asking for money, or if they refuse to give them money they will reveal to her family that she's a sex worker ... this type of blackmail,\" Lepine said.  But registered sex workers are also more willing to report clients' violence to police, according to Lepine's findings, an aspect of the system that is praised by women like Binta.  \"If a registered worker has a problem with a client, they can get justice with their card,\" Binta said, explaining that unregistered prostitutes have no means of legal recourse.  Khadija, a 37-year-old unregistered sex worker who lives in a concrete compound in one of Dakar's poorest districts, said that if she had an ID card she would have reported being raped to police.  Khadija, photographed at her home in Dakar  Sitting in her bedroom, a news broadcast playing on the muted television behind her, Khadija recalled the night she was assaulted by a client. She said she was robbed by the man, who forced himself on her without a condom.  But, she said, she would rather risk the consequences of not having a card -- which include arrest -- than face the stigma associated with it. She's been locked up twice for soliciting sex without an ID. The second time, she spent 45 days in jail. Now she's more cautious about where she meets clients.  \"When you don't have the card, the stigma is there, but with the card it's even more,\" Khadija said, underlining the double-edged sword of the legal system that so many women describe.  Khadija recalled an incident from several years ago, when she went to a nearby police station to resolve a dispute with her landlord, and a man came in to report that he was robbed by a prostitute. The police, she said, showed him a booklet of photos of registered women working in the area.  A news broadcast plays on a TV in Khadija's bedroom  CNN reached out to Senegal's National Police about the incident, but they did not respond.  Khadija said she couldn't face the possibility of her profession being so easily revealed.  \"My main concern is my family. I don't want them to know. I don't care about anything else,\" said Khadija, who lives with her elderly mother, as well as a friend, who also works clandestinely.  Providing alternatives  Khadija is among a group of women that serve as peer-to-peer educators, working with non-profit organization Enda Sant\u00e9 to organize meetings, distribute free condoms, and share advice with other sex workers in Dakar.  Daouda Diouf, director of Enda Sant\u00e9, says that leaders like Khadija have been instrumental in building trust within the community, allowing them to reach unregistered women. He says that, since Enda started operating its grassroots program 15 years ago, the prevalence of HIV in Senegal's sex work population has dropped from more than 20% to 5-6%. Diouf credits that success to the nonprofit's mobile clinic, which treats women on their own terms, providing services at night in the neighborhoods where they meet clients.  A clandestine sex worker approaches the Enda Sant\u00e9 mobile clinic for a check-up with a doctor  \"Working with sex workers is the thing that is keeping Senegal in control of the (HIV) epidemic,\" Diouf said. \"But the reality is not only on the public health and technical approach side, it's also society, religion, and community that has to be taken into account.\"  For both registered and unregistered women, the realities they face are often the same: juggling jobs, caring for children alone, supporting aging parents, navigating nights out,meeting new clients and trying to stay safe.  On a Saturday evening, many of the seaside bars in Almadies, Dakar's nightlife district, are packed with sex workers and their clients. Some women are carrying cards, and some are not.  When Binta works there on the weekend she always takes her ID card, concealing it in a secret compartment of her purse.  \"If I could change one thing, it would be to remove the photo and my residence from the card,\" says Binta, who is saving up money to open a multi-service shop for fixing computers.  She says she doesn't want it to define who she is.

She was turning blue. Literally.  Drs. Otis Warren and Benjamin Blackwood wrote about the case in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday. Their patient, they wrote, looked \"cyanotic,\" the clinical term for appearing blue.  They attributed her blueness to a numbing agent the woman was using, which deadens nerve endings in the skin.  \"She reported having used large amounts of topical benzocaine the night before for a toothache,\" the two co-authors wrote.  Warren, an emergency medicine physician at Miriam Hospital in Providence, told CNN he'd only ever seen one other \"blue\" patient while completing his residency. It stuck with him, so he was immediately able to identify the woman's condition.  \"It's one of those rare cases that we're taught about, you study for, you take tests on, but you rarely ever see,\" he told CNN.  Her condition kept blood from tissue  Warren diagnosed her with \"acquired methemoglobinemia,\" a reaction caused by certain medicines that stops blood from carrying oxygen to tissue, he said.  Oxygen-rich blood is typically associated with a bright-red color. But even though blood appears blue in patients with methemoglobinemia, oxygen levels are actually quite high, Warren said.  Blood \"selfishly binds\" with oxygen and doesn't release it to the tissue where it's needed. And thus, the patient appears blue.  It's fitting that the antidote is a brilliant blue, too. Methylene blue returns a missing electron to the hemoglobin molecule that restores oxygen levels and helps release oxygen back into tissue, he said.  \"In my field, emergency medicine, when you can cure a patient with a single antidote--that's a rare thing for us,\" he said.  Numbing medication caused her reaction  In his patient's case, her reaction was caused by benzocaine, an active ingredient found in over-the-counter toothache and cold sore medicine. And while hers is a rare side effect, it warranted a warning from the Food and Drug Administration, which cautioned against its use in children under 2, who sometimes take the medicine to soothe teething pain.  Warren's patient recovered after two doses of methylene blue and an overnight stay at the hospital. But when levels of the mutated blood rise 50% or higher, patients can enter a coma or develop heart and brain complications from the lack of blood to tissue. Any amount over 60% can cause death, he said.", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-19T02:58:04", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ThkYoCFXzLQ/index.html", "title": "The wearable cyborgs that use brain waves to power up your muscles", "text": "Tokyo (CNN) Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down last year.  \"It came out of nowhere,\" says Sorensen. \"I'd been fine and exercising every day, but it just started with tingling in my fingertips then progressed.\"  Diagnosed in October 2018 with Guillain Barre syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the body's nervous system, she never expected to walk again.  But earlier that year, the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center in Jacksonville, Florida, became the first US center to use a unique rehabilitative technology developed in Japan -- the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL).  HAL -- essentially a wearable cyborg -- helps those with spinal cord injuries and muscular dystrophy regain their movements and strengthen their nerves and muscles. Known as exoskeletons, they're a type of lightweight suit, with joints powered by small electric motors, that serve as mechanical muscle.  Here's what's truly mind-blowing: Patients use their brain waves to control them.  When Sorensen heard about the brain wave-controlled exoskeleton, which was developed by Japanese roboticist Yoshiyuki Sankai, she knew she had to give it a try. She was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding a few months later in December.  But it's not just those with disabilities or injuries who stand to benefit. By 2050, there will be more than 2 billion people over age 60, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and exoskeletons could offer a solution to the world's aging population.  In the future, as human bodies wear down with age, an exoskeleton -- powered by active minds -- could help people stay on their feet.  by 2023, according to research company Markets and Markets. With such huge potential applications available, the global medical exoskeleton market will be worth an estimated $2.8 billion by 2023, according to research company Markets and Markets.  Users in the driving seat  When Sorensen first tried HAL, she could barely move across flat surfaces.  A trained physiotherapist at the Brooks Center helped her fit HAL over her waist and trousers, connecting her to sensors that help pick up faint bio-electric signals on the surface of the skin, which communicate a patient's intention to move. Once HAL receives these signals, it helps support the person's movements.  Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down in 2018.  But you can't just put on HAL and expect to be sprinting in seconds. Rehabilitation requires time, determination and the help of a physiotherapist and a body weight harness that ensures patients are supported and kept upright while they use HAL on a treadmill. During that training, physiotherapists keep a log of each patient's motions and the settings used -- from walk to jog mode. They can monitor the user's movements and adjust the settings accordingly, so their movements come more naturally.  Sorensen says it initially felt like HAL was doing most of the work by helping induce her muscles to make small leg movements that mimic natural walking patterns, but then she found herself increasingly in the driving seat.  \"After the first couple times, your brain connects to HAL, and I could see I was moving my legs myself,\" she says. \"It was just incredible -- my heart was just bursting.\"  Kristen Sorensen was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding. She overcame her paralysis by training with HAL.  Usually it takes those with less severe mobility issues than Sorensen between two to 10 tries for patients to get used to HAL so that the sensors and the brain can start working together, according to Sankai. But after almost 40 training sessions, each lasting an hour-and-a-half, Sorensen was back on her feet, albeit with the support of a walker. She made it to her daughter's wedding.  Currently, Sankai's exoskeletons are helping patients restore their muscle movements in Japan, the Philippines and in Germany and Poland.  Tech for good  The brain behind HAL is bespectacled billionaire roboticist Sankai. He heads up Japanese company Cyberdyne -- founded in 2004 -- where his vision has been to create these \"wearable cyborgs\" designed to \"fuse man, machine and information.\"  And while the name of Sankai's firm might recall the scary Cyberdyne Technologies that created villainous robots in US science-fiction blockbuster \"Terminator,\" the Japanese roboticist wants to create tech not for war, but for peace and rehabilitation.  Yoshiyuki Sankai wants to augment humanity with his exoskeleton devices.  When Sankai was a 9-year-old in the 1960s, he discovered \"I, Robot\" by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov and became entranced by the positive applications of technology. He decided to pursue engineering at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. In 1998, Sankai made his first HAL prototype, which became the world's first , and spent the next decades refining the product into the sleek, lightweight version of today.  Previously robotic-assistance tech centered on military use. But these days, HAL is part of a wave of research that focuses on using exoskeleton tech to treat ailments or provide support to wearers. For example, researchers at Harvard unveiled a soft exosuit in 2014 that enhances a patient's strength, much like HAL. And automobile makers like Ford are using exoskeletons on factory floors to reduce worker fatigue . HAL, too, has potential beyond the medical field, with everything from rescue and support and labor intensive factory work to entertainment and elderly care.  \"The average age of workers (in Japan) is very high, so these technologies can help them and gradually increase elderly people's physical functions so they can remain independent,\" says Sankai.  But when new technologies are created there are few or no social and legal rules to regulate them.  Sankai says these measures must be debated in advance so all parties involved in the manufacture and use of technologies such as exoskeletons maintain control over the development direction. Cyberdyne has two ethics committees; one dedicated to promoting research; the other on standing by the idea of peace when creating and developing new devices and technologies.  Next up, Sankai and his team are collecting data on their treatment method to better improve their existing medical devices. Sankai's aim is to prepare medical devices that will maintain and increase human health for longer.  For now, he is happy seeing everyone from seniors to the severely disabled regain independence. It's a thought that Sorensen shares.  \"When I used HAL, there were people who came from all over the country to use the equipment,\" she says. \"I would like this kind of technology to be more readily available.\"", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-19T13:22:40", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DTLAbvrHc3s/index.html", "title": "How to kick-start your brain in the morning (and no, we don't just mean coffee)", "text": "(CNN) The alarm goes off and you shudder awake, unsure of where you are.

The country's department of health said the disease was \"re-emerging,\" with a case confirmed in a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur, on the southern island of Mindanao, and a suspected case awaiting confirmation.  The World Health Organization said it was \"very concerned\" at the re-emergence of the disease in the country; UNICEF described it as \"deeply disconcerting.\"  A global campaign to eradicate polio was launched in 1998 and cases due to the wild poliovirus have decreased by more than 99% since then, from an estimated 350,000 cases to 33 reported cases in 2018, according to WHO.  However, the disease is still present in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the emergence of new, vaccine-derived strains of polio have complicated efforts to rid the world of the disease.  The last known case of wild poliovirus in the Philippines was in 1993. The country was declared wild polio-free in 2000 along with the rest of WHO's Western Pacific Region.  The Philippines case was unexpected and the country was not on a list of at-risk countries compiled by the Polio Global Eradication Initiative.  Vaccination drive  In addition to the confirmed and suspected cases, the polio virus was detected in samples taken from sewage in the capital, Manila, and in waterways in Davao, Mindanao, the country's third-largest city, as part of the regular environmental surveillance, the department said. The samples were verified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Japan National Institute for Infectious Diseases.  The government said it was preparing a rapid response to the outbreak in coordination with WHO and UNICEF, with a mass polio immunization campaign for all children under 5 starting in October.  \"We strongly urge parents, health workers and local governments to fully participate in the synchronized polio vaccination,\" Philippines Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement.  \"It is the only way to stop the polio outbreak and to protect your child against this paralyzing disease.\"  Polio is an infectious disease which spreads rapidly. It can cause paralysis and, on rare occasions, can be fatal. There is no cure for polio -- it can only be prevented with multiple doses of polio vaccines, WHO said.  \"Aside from immunization, we remind the public to practice good personal hygiene, wash their hands regularly, use toilets, drink safe water, and cook food thoroughly,\" Duque added.  Trust in vaccines was undermined in the Philippines after the government was forced to suspend a dengue fever vaccination program in 2017. The drug was distributed to more than 800,000 students as part of a school-based government immunization program, but was halted after clinical trial data showed that it could have unintended consequences in non-infected patients.  Wild vs vaccine-derived polio  The 3-year-old girl was found to have a vaccine-derived strain of polio virus type 2, which WHO said was of particular concern because the wild strain of this virus was eradicated in 2015.  Vaccine-derived polio happens when live strains of poliovirus that are used in the oral poliovirus vaccine mutate, spread and, in rare cases, trigger an outbreak. Most of the time the virus dies off but it can sometimes spread in an area where there is low vaccination coverage.  \"If a population is not sufficiently immunized, the weakened virus can continue to circulate. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more changes it undergoes. In rare instances, the virus can change to a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a form that has regained the ability to cause paralysis,\" WHO said.  \"Poorly conducted immunization activities, when too few children have received the required three doses of polio vaccine, leave them susceptible to poliovirus, either from vaccine-derived or wild polioviruses. Full immunization protects them from both forms of the virus,\" it added.", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-19T15:28:45", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/83ukKSzK3kI/index.html", "title": "'I am worried there will be fewer of us,' says campaigner against Down syndrome test", "text": "(CNN) Natalie Dedreux has spent months campaigning against a plan to make a blood test for Down syndrome free in Germany .  While its proponents say the prenatal test is a safer alternative to current procedures and should be available to everyone, Dedreux believes it will lead to people like her being \"sorted out.\"  Dedreux, a 20-year aspiring journalist from Cologne, has the condition. \"I am worried that if pregnant women find out their baby has Down syndrome, they will decide against us .... because they are scared,\" she wrote on her blog  She has attended protests against the plan and has met German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss it. She also started a petition that has been signed by more than 20,000 people.  Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. It can result in learning disabilities and distinctive facial characteristics.  The syndrome can be detected during pregnancy, but the common way of doing that -- by using a needle to take a sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding a baby in the womb -- is invasive and carries a risk. According to the UK's National Health Service, the procedure carries an estimated 1 in 100 chance of causing a miscarriage.  non-invasive test is already available in Germany, but women who want to take it have to pay for it privately. It costs between \u20ac150 and \u20ac300 and works by looking at the DNA of the unborn baby, which floats freely in its mother's blood.  Germany's Federal Joint Committee has on Thursday decided that the test should be free for women with high-risk pregnancies.  The body represents doctors, hospitals and health insurance funds and makes decisions on which medical services should be covered by the country's mandatory medical insurance. However, the committee said the test should only be available together with \"intensive\" counselling. It said that it would be unethical to use it as a \"screening.\" It also suggested developing a special information system for those who take it.  However, the decision is not yet final \u2014 the issue will now be considered by the Federal Ministry of Health, which can veto it.  A less risky test  Germany's health minister, Jens Spahn, has spoken in favor of making the test free. He said it is much less risky than the amniotic fluid procedure, which is already free for women whose pregnancies are deemed high-risk.  \"The financial situation of the woman should not be a factor, it's not acceptable that only women with enough money could afford the test,\" said Christine Aschenberg-Dugnus, a member of the German parliament for FDP and another advocate of making the procedure free.  She said that it would be wrong to force women to pay for the less invasive procedure while the risky one is free, but added she doesn't think the test should be required. \"There is a right to know, but also a right not to know.\"  The German Society for Gynecology and Obstetrics also said the test should be free for women with high-risk pregnancies because it's safer than the current method.  'Life with Down syndrome is cool'  Down syndrome support groups have spoken against the plan.  But Down syndrome support groups and the Catholic church are warning against the move, saying it could lead to more abortions and to families with disabled children being stigmatized.  \"I am worried these supposedly harmless instruments will pave the way to 'selection mentality,' \" said Thomas Sternberg, the president of the Central Committee of German Catholics.  In a statement issued by the church, he added that it must not be the case that parents who opt not to have the test would need to justify their choice.  Bishop Gebhard F\u00fcrst, who chairs the bioethics committee of the German Bishops' Conference, said that \"selecting human life based on genetic criteria\" goes against the duty to respect the dignity of human life.  Statistics from countries including the UK and Denmark show that a majority of women who get a Down syndrome diagnosis in the early stages of pregnancy opt for a termination.  Abortion is only permitted in Germany in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and only following a specialist consultation. Termination later than that is only legal if there is a medical reason or if the fetus is diagnosed with a disorder, including Down syndrome.  \"It is not social progress if the life of unborn children is questioned prenatally due to their genetic characteristics,\" said Dr. Elzbieta Szczebak, the managing director of the German Down Syndrome InfoCenter. \"In times of inclusion it is a social step backwards.\"  Dedreux, the aspiring journalist, said she was worried that free testing will lead to fewer babies being born with Down syndrome. \"It's not good to be alone,\" she said.  \"You shouldn't be afraid of us anymore, life with with Down syndrome is cool.\"", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-17T20:37:52", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/YFZ0Z-OY86o/index.html", "title": "The US and UK see vaping very differently. Here's why", "text": "(CNN) An outbreak of a vaping-related illness in the United States has sickened hundreds and may be linked to the deaths of seven people , and an epidemic of youth vaping there has been called a \"public health crisis.\"  President Donald Trump's administration moved to ban e-cigarette flavors and there are warnings to avoid vaping altogether, and  But in the UK, there doesn't appear to be an outbreak of vaping-related sickness. Neither has vaping's popularity soared among young people who never smoked. Rather, e-cigarettes have been embraced mostly as a way for adults to quit combustible cigarettes. Indeed, health authorities in the UK stand by their support for e-cigarettes as a cessation tool.  \"If you don't smoke, don't vape,\" said John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England. \"But if you smoke there is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.  \"PHE's advice remains that e-cigarettes are a fraction of the risk of smoking, and using one makes it much more likely you'll quit successfully than relying on willpower alone.\"  What's different? Regulation, especially on advertising and promotion, and the levels of nicotine in vaping products.  \"In the UK the culture is that this is a replacement and not an initiation product,\" said Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics in Stanford Medicine's Division of Adolescent Medicine.  The great vape debate  In a review last year, Public Health England found that vaping is 95% less harmful than smoking conventional cigarettes and was helping 20,000 people quit a year. The agency was concerned that more than half of smokers \"falsely believed that vaping is as harmful as smoking.\"  \"There is much public misunderstand about nicotine,\" the body said, with \"less than 10% of adults understand that most of the harms to health from smoking are not caused by nicotine.\"  It also said that concern about e-cigarette use as a gateway to smoking among young people wasn't supported by evidence in the UK, where regular vaping among young people who've never smoked is less than 1%  \"Similar choice of flavors exist in the US and UK and yet we do not have the same levels of youth vaping here. Our much lower rates are due to our much stricter advertising regulations and possibly our lower nicotine cap,\" a spokesperson for Public Health England said Thursday.  Halpern-Felsher noted those differences, too.  \"In the UK, first of all, they are not allowing advertisements in the same way and so you don't get advertisements to young people,\" Halpern-Felsher said. Outdoor advertisements on buses, for example, are allowed, but \"e-cigarette companies just don't have the presence on social media and in the TV or radio.\"  In the United States, more than a quarter of high school students were current e-cigarette users in 2019, according to preliminary numbers from the National Youth Tobacco Survey revealed last week.  The EU's Tobacco Products Directive, which took effect in 2016, lays down rules on the manufacture, presentation and sale of e-cigarettes in member countries. This includes restrictions on labeling, packaging and advertising. An EU report on the health and environmental risks of e-cigarettes is due by the end of 2020.  more potent. EU regulations also restrict e-cigarette liquids used in vaping devices to a nicotine strength of no more than 20mg/ml but in the US, some Juulpods contain 59 mg/ml , making themmore potent.  A 5% nicotine Juulpod contains \"the amount of nicotine found in two packs of cigarettes -- one and a half to two packs,\" Halpern-Felsher said . \"Whereas the UK would not allow that.\"  Juul says a 5% strength Juulpod is designed to replace one pack of cigarettes in terms of the number of puffs and the nicotine strength. The company says its studies \"have consistently shown that use of JUUL products with 5% nicotine strength results in a nicotine uptake similar to, but lower in concentration than, a cigarette,\" and that Juul's \"nicotine experience\" was developed to help adult smokers transition from combustible cigarettes.  Regulatory differences  That's not to say there's no concern over the safety of e-cigarettes in the UK.  One 2018 study found that, among young people in Great Britain, those who had ever smoked were more likely to start vaping -- and those who had ever used an e-cigarette, even if they weren't smokers, were more likely to start smoking.  Public Health England said that vaping \"is not completely without risks\" and stressed that vapers should use \"UK-regulated e-liquids and never risk vaping home-made or illicit e-liquids or adding substances, any of which could be harmful.\"  And the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said 62 reports of adverse reactions linked to e-cigarettes had been reported by the public and health professionals between May 20, 2016 and September 6, 2019.  It's a far cry from the United States, where illness and addiction have hoisted vaping into headlines.  The CDC says there are 380 confirmed and probable cases of lung disease associated with e-cigarette product use, or vaping. It's not clear what's causing the illnesses, although some of the patients vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The US Food and Drug Administration also said in August it was investigating 127 reports of seizures that might be linked to vaping.  The Trump administration's moves to ban e-cigarette flavors \"will serve as a powerful tool that the FDA can use to combat the troubling trend of youth e-cigarette use. We must act swiftly against flavored e-cigarette products that are especially attractive to children,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless said last week. \"The tremendous progress we've made in reducing youth tobacco use in the US is jeopardized by this onslaught of e-cigarette use.  \"Nobody wants to see children becoming addicted to nicotine, and we will continue to use the full scope of our regulatory authority thoughtfully and thoroughly to tackle this mounting public health crisis.\"  Some in the UK were critical of the Trump administration's plan.  Dan Marchant, the owner and founder of Vape Club in the United Kingdom and founding member of the UK Vaping Industry Association, warns that banning products could \"create a black market\" -- an argument that has been made by US vaping advocates , as well.  \"We know prohibition doesn't work. Regulation does work,\" Marchant said. \"From the UK perspective, we have a very highly regulated market ... The diseases that are being reported don't really correlate with the ingredients in professionally manufactured e-liquids.\"  Professor Linda Bauld, professor of public health at University of Edinburgh, said that it would be a mistake for the United States to ban flavored e-cigarettes.  \"It is true that a rising number of American teenagers have tried or recently used flavored vapes and this has caused alarm. But by removing all these products from the market, the proposed US policy forgets that the flavors are an important part of the appeal to adult smokers trying to quit smoking,\" she said.  \"In Europe, flavored e-cigarettes have contributed to recent declines in adult smoking and well-conducted randomized controlled trials show that these products do help people quit.\"  Views on vaping around the world  Some 35 million people around the world are believed to be using e-cigarettes or newer heat-not-burn products, according to data and research company Euromonitor.  They are popular among smokers in many places trying to kick the habit, as they satisfy the urge for nicotine while removing exposure to the tar and toxins of burned tobacco, but many worry they're creating new addictions to nicotine, particularly among young people.

Dr. Vinayak Prasad, head of the World Health Organization tobacco control program , told CNN in an email on Thursday that WHO \"was actively monitoring developments in the US and other countries and will update governments in due course,\" adding that its member states hadn't reported similar lung illnesses to those seen in the United States.  The organization also hasn't thrown its weight behind the use of e-cigarettes as a way to quit.  \"The scientific evidence on e-cigarettes as cessation aids is inconclusive and there is a lack of clarity as to whether these products have any role to play in smoking cessation,\" the global health body said in a July report. \"There are also real concerns about the risk they pose to non-smokers who start to use them, especially young people.\"", "company": "cnnHealth"}, {"published": "2019-09-17T17:33:16", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/C6DIQ9-oE0A/index.html", "title": "The way you vape could make it even more dangerous", "text": "In the wake of six deaths and 380 cases of confirmed and probable lung disease across the US, the Trump administration has called for banning most flavored e-cigarettes because of their huge appeal to young people.

His method could help millions", "text": "(CNN) It was just after Christmas in 2013 and David Fajgenbaum was hovering a hair above death.  He lay in a hospital bed at the University of Arkansas, stricken with a rare disease. His blood platelet count was so low that even a slight bump to his body could trigger a lethal brain bleed. A doctor told him to write his living will on a piece of paper.  Fajgenbaum was rushed to a CT scan. Tears streamed down his face and fell on his hospital gown. He thought about the first patient who'd died under his care in medical school, and how her brain had bled in a similar way from a stroke.  He didn't believe he'd live out the scan.  But he did. Turns out his headache wasn't a brain bleed -- just sinus pressure. The chemo had kicked in.  Fajgenbaum was battling Castleman disease, a rare autoimmune disorder involving an overgrowth of cells in the body's lymph nodes. It wasn't the first time a relapse had threatened his life. Massive \"shock and awe\" chemotherapy regimes had helped him narrowly escape death during four previous attacks, but each new assault on his body weakened him.  \"You learn a lot by almost dying,\" he says.  He learned enough to surprise his doctors by coming up with a way to treat his disease. Almost six years later he's in remission, he and his wife have a baby girl and he's devoting his medical career to saving other patients like him.  His story has lessons for the future of rare disease research -- and for living.  His first love was football  As a boy in Raleigh, North Carolina, Fajgenbaum spent Saturdays on the sidelines watching the NC State Wolfpack with his dad, the team's doctor.  At age 7, he was obsessed with becoming a Division 1 athlete. In middle school he would wake up at 5 a.m. to go running. The walls of his bedroom were covered with football play charts.  David Fajgenbaum training for football at Georgetown University.  He achieved his dream, making the Georgetown University football team as a quarterback. But during his sophomore year in 2004, his mother died of cancer.  His obsessive focus deepened, helping him learn to appreciate life's precious moments and understand bad things can still happen to good people.  \"I know people far more worthy of miracles than I am who haven't gotten them,\" he says.  Fajgenbaum then earned a master's degree at Oxford University, where he learned how to conduct scientific research so that he could fight the disease that took his mom.  That relentless focus and scientific rigor would one day save his life.  In medical school a rare disease nearly killed him  Fajgenbaum entered medical school at the University of Pennsylvania to become a doctor like his father -- specifically, an oncologist, in tribute to his late mother.  During his third year, in 2010, he got very sick and was hospitalized for five months. Something was attacking his liver, kidneys and other organs and shutting them down.  The diagnosis was idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease.  First described in 1954, Castleman presents partly like an autoimmune condition, and partly like cancer. It's about as rare as ALS -- there are about 7,000 new cases each year in the US.  The disease causes certain immune signaling molecules, called cytokines, to go into overdrive. It's like they're calling in fighter jets for all-out attacks on home territory.  Fajgenbaum's doctors knew his body was in a civil war, but they had questions about how and why.  Fajgenbaum's book, an account of his illness and recovery, came out this week.  In his hospital bed, Fajgenbaum felt nauseated and weak. His organs were failing and he noticed curious red spots on his skin. But his doctors, focused on saving his life, weren't interested in these \"blood moles.\"  He asked each new doctor who came in his room what the blood moles meant.  \"They went out their way to say they didn't matter,\" Fajgbenbuam says. But the med student-turned-patient would go on to prove he was on to something.  \"Patients pick up on things no one else sees,\" he says.  He suffered life-threatening relapses  Castleman disease struck Fajgenbaum four more times over the next three years, with hospitalizations that ranged from weeks to months.  But even with a top Castleman specialist treating him, there were many unknowns. Fajgenbaum stayed alive only through intense chemotherapy \"carpet bombing\" campaigns.  As he repeatedly faced down death, he grieved most for the memories he still hadn't made: graduating from medical school, marrying his college sweetheart and looking into his son or daughter's eyes.  David Fajgenbaum poses with his father during one of his hospital stays.  During one relapse at a Duke University hospital, his family called in a priest to read him his last rites.  After all the setbacks, all the organ failure, all the chemo, Fajgenbaum worried that his body would simply break.  Despite four hospitalizations, he managed to graduate from medical school. His life depended on it.  He needed to change how medical research is done  Rather than starting a residency like most of his medical school classmates, Fajgenbaum began an MBA at Penn's Wharton School in 2013.  He also founded the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network , a global initiative devoted to fighting Castleman disease. Many of his business-school classmates joined the cause. Fajgenbaum figured that adding a CEO mindset would enable him to scale up his approach to curing himself.  Coordinating data-sharing efforts between labs required him to use \"every negotiation, strategic decision-making and managerial economics course I took in business school,\" he wrote in his book.  Through the CDCN he began bringing the world's top Castleman disease researchers together for meetings in the same room. His group worked with doctors and researchers as well as patients to prioritize the studies that needed to be done soonest.  Rather than having people apply for grants, they hand-pick the best researchers to investigate Castleman.  A recent photo of Fajgenbaum in his office at the University of Pennsylvania.  Fajgenbaum also prioritized clinical trials that re-purposed drugs the FDA had already approved as safe rather than starting from scratch with new compounds.  Meanwhile, he never knew if the next relapse might finally kill him. Staving them off meant flying to North Carolina every three weeks to receive chemotherapy treatments.  Even so, he proposed to his college sweetheart, Caitlin Prazenica, handing her a letter written from his niece to her \"Aunt Caitlin,\" that said, in part, \"I'm a really good flower girl.\"  \"The disease wasn't a hindrance to me,\" says his now-wife. \"I just wanted to be together.\"  But in late 2013 Castleman struck again, landing him in that Arkansas hospital. It marked his closest brush with death yet.  He pioneered a brand new treatment  Before he and Prazenica could send out their save-the-date postcards, Fajgenbaum set out to try and save his own life.  After examining his medical charts, he zeroed in on an idea that -- more than 60 years after Castleman disease was discovered -- researchers hadn't yet explored.  A protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, was spiking 10 times its normal level. In medical school he'd learned VEGF controls blood vessel growth, and he hypothesized that the blood moles that had shown up with every Castleman relapse were a direct result of that protein spike, which signals the immune system to take action.  He also knew that there was an immunosuppressant called Sirolimus that was approved by the FDA to help fight the immune system when it activated against kidney transplants.  After consulting with a National Institutes of Health expert, Fajgenbaum asked his doctor to prescribe the drug. He picked it up in February 2014 at a pharmacy less than a mile from his home.  \"A drug that could potentially save my life was hiding in plain sight,\" he says.  Fajgenbaum with his wife Caitlin and their daughter Amelia. The couple were wed in 2014.  So far it's working. Fajgenbaum has been in remission from Castleman for more than five years. He's not the muscular football player he once was, but he's close to full strength.  After three months on Sirolimus, he and Caitlin were wed in a Philadelphia ballroom, their joy amplified by memories of their struggles.  Fajgenbaum is now an assistant medical professor at the University of Pennsylvania, running a research lab and enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the drug that's given him his life back.  He finished the draft of his book in August 2018, in time for the birth of their daughter, Amelia.  \"She's such a little miracle,\" Caitlin Fajgenbaum says. \"We're so lucky to have her.\"  His approach to research can be applied to all rare diseases  There are 7,000 rare diseases affecting 400 million people around the world, according to Global Genes . And just 5% have an FDA-approved treatment.  Fajgenbaum says there's tremendous opportunity for him and others to change that.  \"Because so little time and money has been invested in these diseases, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit,\" he says.  His efforts have come to attention of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , created by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, to treat, manage, and prevent all diseases by the end of the century.  The organization's science policy director, Tania Simoncelli, told CNN it's highlighting Fajgenbaum's CDCN as a model for how to rally a community together to best a rare disease.  \"I haven't seen anyone tackle a disease with that level of organization,\" she says. \"He didn't wait for the stars to align. He aligned them himself.\"  Research for many rare diseases suffers because there isn't a disease-wide plan and a \"quarterback\" to lead it, Simoncelli says.  So for the last 10 months Fajgenbaum's group and the CZI have been working together to help rare-disease communities bring together patients, researchers and doctors to get the right research done as fast as possible.  \"Part of his brilliance is that his model can be turned into a series of steps,\" Simoncelli says.  Fajgenbaum hopes his story offers lessons, far beyond medicine, about what people can do when they're backed against a wall.  And he feels his suffering means something when he looks in the eyes of his patients with Castleman disease. One girl named Katie was diagnosed at age 2 and endured 14 hospitalizations.  Then her doctor prescribed Fajgenbaum's drug after the family reached out to the CDCN. Katie hasn't been hospitalized since and just graduated from kindergarten.

Around 10,000 of those are foreigners from more than 40 countries who made the journey to join the Islamic State in Syria, and they are among the most fiercely committed extremists, according to camp officials.  Tensions in the camp have risen sharply since Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivered an audio address last month urging his followers to \u201ctear down the walls\u201d of the camps and prisons housing detainees to free them, SDF officials say. The women have set up their own Islamic State-style sharia courts and are inflicting physical punishments on ordinary camp residents who reject their ideology.  One of the SDF\u2019s foremost wishes is for governments to alleviate some of the burden on the SDF by repatriating their citizens, Mazloum said. But most governments are refusing to take them back.  The Kurdish administration also needs help with funding to secure, feed and house the detainees, he said. The town-sized camp, sprawled across a remote stretch of desert near the Iraqi border, is surrounded only by a rusty, sagging chain-link fence. Floodlights \u2014 paid for by the Kurds \u2014 to detect breakouts at night were smashed almost immediately by women throwing rocks, Mazloum said. The guards have no night vision equipment, and the few closed-circuit TV cameras are useless after sunset.  Smugglers sympathetic to the Islamic State lurk in the desert nearby and close in under cover of darkness and help women and children clamber across the fence.  Mazloum said he believed all of those who have escaped in that way were foreigners, and all were subsequently recaptured. SDF officials concede, however, that it is possible some have managed to get away, and could make their way back to their home countries undetected.  An incident this week heightened fears that the camp is slipping out of control. Guards attempting to intervene to prevent Russian Islamic State women from administering beatings against two women who had failed to obey their rules were confronted by stone-throwing women, two of whom pulled guns, according to the officials. The guards opened fire in the air, according to Mazloum, but aid workers reported that four women were injured by gunshots and the SDF said one woman died.  Compounding the problem are dismal living conditions. Food is scarce, water supplies are contaminated and disease is rife. With winter approaching, the misery will only increase, heightening discontent in the camp and perhaps turning more residents against the SDF, said Mazloum, citing the urgent need for more humanitarian assistance as well.  The U.S. military shares the SDF\u2019s concerns, said Col. Myles B. Caggins lll, a U.S. military spokesman speaking from Baghdad. Although large numbers of the camp\u2019s residents are not Islamic State supporters, \u201cwithout an international solution, the next generation of ISIS combatants may emerge from al-Hol,\u201d he said.  The SDF forces are meanwhile stretched thin across their vast territory, amounting to a third of Syria, by the effort to suppress revived Islamic State activity elsewhere, by continuing threats from Turkey and fears that it plans to invade the northern part of the area, and by the need to defend against possible incursions from the Syrian government to the south.  \u201cAll this is preventing us from focusing on the camp,\u201d Mazloum said. \u201cIf we can remove these challenges, we can manage.\u201d  But, he added, that would require a political settlement to the overall Syrian war \u201cwhich will take a very long time.\u201d  Read more:  At a sprawling tent camp in Syria, ISIS women impose a brutal rule  New suffering for the children of the ISIS caliphate as hunger and sickness spread  The jihadists no one wants  Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world  Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "company": "washingtonpost"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T09:35:00", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqs-top-shiite-cleric-backs-protesters-demands-security-forces-arrest-wounded-civilians-from-hospitals/2019/10/04/d4bb60f4-e625-11e9-b0a6-3d03721b85ef_story.html", "authors": ["Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "Mustafa Salim"], "title": "Iraqi security forces open fire on anti-government protesters as top cleric backs demands", "text": "Crowds have swelled across Baghdad and much of southern Iraq as harsh police tactics have only hardened the resolve of protesters, who initially turned out to decry official corruption. The demonstrations, which appear to be leaderless, are coalescing around a demand for a wholesale change of what they describe as a broken system. Many protesters also have been denouncing Iranian influence in Iraq.  AD  AD  In a widely anticipated Friday sermon, Iraq\u2019s most influential Shiite cleric, the Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, urged the government to implement sweeping reforms and called on both sides to step back from the violence before it was \u201ctoo late.\u201d Sistani\u2019s pronouncements have the potential to dampen or inflame the street protests. Hours after he spoke, another of the country\u2019s most influential clerics, Moqtada al-Sadr, demanded the government\u2019s resignation in the hope that it would preserve the protesters\u2019 \u201cblood.\u201d  The unrest has mostly taken place amid an information blackout. Authorities have suspended Internet service across much of the country, and an indefinite curfew is in place.  In Baghdad, the anxiety on Friday was palpable. Streets were mostly eerily quiet, and families said they were stockpiling food. Prices rose steeply, and roads were cut with barbed wire. Where protests had taken place the night before, masked soldiers fanned out and helicopters circled low.  AD  AD  But near the city\u2019s central Tahrir Square, violence worsened as security forces clashed with hundreds of protesters. The crowd was overwhelmingly young, jobless and male. Security forces, who largely fired bullets in the air in previous days, shot directly at the crowds on Friday, and snipers appeared to be positioned on the rooftops.  One man in his early 20s appeared to have been shot in the head, and his blood spooled out across the asphalt. Other victims were rushed toward ambulances.  Battered by years of conflict and mismanagement, Iraq\u2019s economy is struggling to absorb thousands of young graduates into the job market. Corruption is rife and opportunities, when they arise, are often seen as the preserve of families with political connections. Most jarringly for many, there have been few improvements in the two years since Iraq\u2019s security forces pushed Islamic State militants from cities they had occupied.  AD  AD  \u201cLook at me, look at this blood,\u201d shouted Karrar Alami, 22, near Tahrir Square, gesturing toward a dark-red stain he said came from the wounds of a close friend. \u201cWe fought the Islamic State for them, and all we wanted in return was a job. This is how they repay us.\u201d  Mahdi came to power last year as a consensus prime minister, but promises to tackle corruption and unemployment have gone unfulfilled.  In a lackluster speech Friday, he described the nationwide curfew as \u201cbitter medicine\u201d and asked for patience, saying there were \u201cno magical solutions.\u201d In exercising crowd control, security forces were abiding by \u201cinternational standards,\u201d he said.  AD  But a brief lifting of the Internet blackout to coincide with his speech sent another set of images flooding across social media. In nighttime videos from neighborhoods where security forces appeared to have little control, protesters held up spent bullet casings by the handful.  AD  \u201cThere seems to be a calculation by those who are trying to protect the political system that there\u2019s a level of violence that is acceptable,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank. \u201cIf you listen to what the protesters are calling for, it\u2019s not about getting rid of Abdel Mahdi. It\u2019s about calling for an end to the whole system. They\u2019re fed up with the government\u2019s inability to reform and bringing in new faces won\u2019t help.\u201d  Iraq\u2019s human rights commission said Friday that the government had yet to disclose the full extent of the week\u2019s casualties and accused security forces of arresting wounded demonstrators from hospitals across the country.  AD  Ali al-Bayati, the commission\u2019s spokesman, said that 35 people had been detained from hospitals in the southern city of Nasiriyeh and that arrests had also taken place inside facilities in Wasit and Diwaniyah.  AD  In Baghdad\u2019s Sheikh Zayed Hospital, a medic said that Shiite paramilitaries were monitoring the arrival of the wounded. In one instance, he said, gunmen had shot at an ambulance to prevent a patient from reaching the facility to undergo brain surgery.

Some blame a changing climate.", "text": "  In an effort to curb the spread of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases in Kathmandu, Nepal, by killing mosquito larvae, a worker uses a fogging machine. (Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images)  His boss fell sick first, with aching pains and a high temperature. Then, some of his colleagues began showing similar symptoms. By the time Rajkumar Adhikari, 35, grew feverish and started vomiting, he learned that the sickness had a name: dengue.  Adhikari, a technician at a company that makes batteries in Nepal\u2019s capital, said he had not heard of dengue before this year, when it struck half of the staff at his office. He felt weak, his nose began to bleed and his joints were so painful it was \u201chard to bear,\u201d he said from his hospital bed last month.  Nepal, a Himalayan nation wedged between India and China, is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of dengue this year, part of a broader resurgence in the mosquito-borne viral disease that experts say is linked to a changing climate. In Nepal, there have been nearly 11,000 cases of dengue since mid-July, according to government figures, more than five times the previous annual peak.  Nepal is far from alone. From Brazil to Bangladesh, Honduras to the Philippines, the number of reported dengue cases has surged this year. There has been a \u201chuge increase,\u201d said Raman Velayudhan, the task force lead for dengue at the World Health Organization. \u201cUnfortunately, things are a little grim at the moment.\u201d  Preliminary figures from the WHO show 2.7 million reported cases worldwide through August. This year\u2019s final tally is likely to match the worst years on record for dengue, Velayudhan said. In the Philippines alone, more than 1,000 people have died.  Dengue turns out to be ideally suited for a warming, urbanizing world. Present in fewer than 10 countries in the 1970s, it has since spread to more than 120. Dengue is fatal in less than 1 percent of cases and most people recover on their own, but careful supervision is sometimes required to treat severe manifestations of the disease. There is no medication to cure it, nor is there a widely approved vaccine.  As climate change brings rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall patterns, researchers say that 500 million more people could be at risk of contracting diseases like dengue over the next 30 years. Dengue is \u201cheaded out of the tropics and it\u2019s also headed to higher elevations,\u201d said Colin Carlson, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University who studies the link between climate and mosquito-borne illnesses. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which climate change threatens global health.\u201d  The mosquito that spreads dengue \u2014 Aedes aegypti \u2014 thrives in warm temperatures and urban environments. The ideal temperature range for the mosquito to transmit the virus is between about 70 and 93 degrees, researchers say. Meanwhile, its larvae can breed in the amount of standing water held by a bottle cap.  \u201cIn general, if you have warmer and wetter conditions, it\u2019s more favorable to the mosquito,\u201d said Rachel Lowe, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. But dengue outbreaks can also occur during droughts, when people are forced to store water, she said.  Lowe added that the spread of dengue is also driven by the unplanned growth of cities, whose dense populations provide ample opportunities for contact between humans and mosquitoes and offer plenty of containers where larvae can grow.  Another worrying characteristic of the dengue virus is its four strains. If people are infected with one strain, they will develop an immunity to it. But if the same people are subsequently infected by a different strain, they are more likely to develop a severe case of dengue, raising the possibility of more serious outbreaks in the future.  Adhikari, the technician in Nepal, was sick for five days before being admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. When his colleagues realized that dengue was working its way through the office, they began to kill any mosquitoes they could find and sought out areas where the insects could breed: an upturned lid, a blocked drain, a collection of plastic waste.    A woman covers her face as workers fumigate in Kathmandu. (Narendra Shrestha/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)  Anup Bastola, a senior doctor at the hospital where Adhikari was treated, said that he saw about a dozen dengue cases last year after the country\u2019s monsoon. This year, the rains arrived early \u2014 and the number of dengue patients spiked. Since mid-July, the hospital has diagnosed at least 2,500 cases and admitted more than 260 dengue patients, he said.  \u201cIt was terrible. I\u2019ve never seen such a situation in this hospital,\u201d Bastola said. He now spends 11-hour days at the hospital and his family jokes that to see him, they need to turn on the television, where he has appeared repeatedly to educate the public on dengue and the need for mosquito control. Eight of the hospital\u2019s staff members were infected, and Bastola found a vessel wriggling with mosquito larvae on a hospital balcony.  In Nepal, people were either unaware of dengue, Bastola said, or considered it a disease of the country\u2019s Terai region, the lowlands in the south that border India. But this year, cases have been reported in 67 of the country\u2019s 77 districts, including hilly and mountainous areas. At least six people have died. The country\u2019s agriculture minister and a prominent ophthalmologist were reportedly infected, spurring a minor panic in Kathmandu.  Bibek Kumar Lal, a doctor who heads the epidemiology and disease-control division of Nepal\u2019s Health Ministry, remarked, half in jest, that his division should be renamed the \u201cdengue control\u201d division.  In September, Lal said, the prime minister\u2019s office organized a meeting to help coordinate the response to the upsurge in dengue cases. Lal acknowledged that this year\u2019s outbreak was the start of a much longer battle. \u201cOur next generation is going to live with dengue,\u201d he said.  In a bare ward on the second floor of the hospital, several dengue patients rested on their beds as watery sunlight came in the window. Bhupal Dangi, 46, had arrived earlier that morning after driving 11 hours from his home in a district more than 250 miles away. He had been sick for six days, with a bad fever and pain in his joints. He felt so weak he couldn\u2019t clench his fists.  \u201cThe doctors have told us there\u2019s no medicine for dengue,\u201d said his wife, Bhabhi, as she sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will work.\u201d  Adhikari was in the adjacent bed. The owner of his company, the first to get sick, subsequently recovered. So did his colleagues. But Adhikari\u2019s case turned out to be more serious. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I heard about what could happen the second time I get it. That scared me a lot.\u201d    Bhupal Dangi, 46, and his wife, Bhabhi, traveled 11 hours to the hospital in Kathmandu after he fell ill with dengue.

AD  But the prosecutor\u2019s intended audience is not the White House or Capitol Hill, said Oleksiy Baganetz, a former deputy prosecutor general in Ukraine. He is striving to keep public opinion in Ukraine behind him.  \u201cThis is a political issue more than a criminal one,\u201d Baganetz said.  Ryaboshapka reiterated Friday that he has seen no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. He added that no foreign or Ukrainian official had asked him to pursue the audit of the cases.

Ryaboshapka, appointed by Zelensky, has a reputation as a legal reformer, and he vowed to clean up the deeply compromised system of prosecution in Ukraine.  AD  He\u2019s one month into the job, and his supporters want results, Baganetz said.  The reviews, however, may take time and could move far more slowly than the fast-developing political events in Washington.  Oleksandr Lemenov, an anti-corruption activist, said any attempt by outside politicians, Ukrainian or otherwise, to interfere in the business of the prosecutor\u2019s office could prompt widespread resignations among the new, idealistic staff.  AD  Ryaboshapka would have no desire to get caught up in American politics, said Lemenov. \u201cEvery smart top public official should understand that the story about Trump-&-Biden (read Republicans-&-Democrats) is not so fun for us,\u201d he wrote in a text message.  Hunter Biden was invited to join Burisma\u2019s board in 2014. The company\u2019s principal owner, Mykola Zlo\u00adchevsky, had served as minister of ecology and natural resources in the brazenly graft-ridden administration of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after being ousted.  AD  Ryaboshapka said Friday that he was aware of at least 15 cases that were launched against Zlo\u00adchevsky after Yanukovych\u2019s downfall in 2014, all of which focused on the period before Biden joined the board and none of which came to anything. Zlochevsky was accused of illegally awarding licenses to his own companies.  AD  But the chief prosecutor from 2015 to 2016, Viktor Shokin, did little to move those or other corruption cases along. Eventually, Western officials, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, sought his ouster. Shortly after Shokin was fired, the case against Burisma was closed.  Analysis: At town hall, question for GOP senator: \u2018Where is the line?\u2019  That fueled Trump\u2019s insistence that the senior Biden brought pressure on Kiev to protect his son and that a new criminal probe should be undertaken.  But a former deputy to Shokin, David Sakvarelidze, told The Washington Post that the Burisma case was shut down by Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuri Lutsenko, after a deal was reached in which the company agreed to sell natural gas at a favorable price to companies controlled by then-President Petro Poroshenko.  AD  AD  That version is supported by clandestine recordings made by a businessman now in exile, Oleksandr Onyshchenko.  This is the sort of allegation that Ryaboshapka now wants to revisit.  Sakvarelidze said the furor over Trump\u2019s demand and the attention now being paid to Burisma required some response from Ukraine. Ryaboshapka was in a position to give the least politically difficult one.  \u201cHe cannot ignore this issue,\u201d Sakvarelidze said. \u201cBut the other question is, where will this investigation lead?\u201d  The audit does not mark a reopening of the criminal probe. But, in theory, the prosecutor\u2019s office could find enough evidence to bring charges against those who formerly ran it, especially if the allegation of a corrupt deal with Poroshenko is borne out.  AD  And if a criminal case eventually emerges from this, said a former associate, Ruslan Radetzky, \u201cIt will be a Ukrainian matter, and no one else\u2019s.\u201d  AD  At the news conference, Ryaboshapka was asked about correspondence that was turned over to the House on Thursday by Kurt Volker, the former special U.S. envoy for Ukraine. The text messages show that Volker helped arrange a meeting between Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney, and Andrey Yermak, foreign affairs adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, Zelensky.  \u201cThese questions,\u201d Ryaboshapka said, \u201cshould be addressed to the authors of this correspondence.\u201d  He said that his office \u201cis independent of the office of the president and of political influence by that office.\u201d  AD  He also said he was not bothered by Zelensky calling him \u201c100 percent my person\u201d in the July 25 phone call with Trump.

Volker, who as of Thursday was the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, said he did not believe allegations Giuliani has leveled against Biden, namely that Biden was influenced in his dealings with the Ukrainian leadership by his son\u2019s presence on the board of a Ukrainian gas company whose owner was being probed by authorities in Kiev. (Cindy McCain, a Biden friend, chairs the McCain Institute.)  \u201cI have known former vice president Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me,\u201d Volker said, according to a written copy of the opening statement reviewed by The Washington Post. \u201cI know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country.\u201d  Biden is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by the official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past.\u201d  Volker said he was trying to ensure the Trump administration continued its support for Ukraine. \u201cIn carrying out this role, I at some stage found myself faced with a choice: to be aware of a problem and to ignore it, or rather to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it,\u201d Volker said. \u201cI would not have been true to myself, my duties, or my commitment to the people of the United States or Ukraine, if I did not dive in and try to fix problems as best I could.\u201d  [Live updates: Trump says the Democratic-led House has the votes to impeach him]  Volker, who was serving in the special-envoy position in an unpaid capacity, said he was not on the July 25 call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his family. He said he received only a general readout of the conversation.  Volker was also working as executive director of the McCain Institute and was a consultant for the lobbying firm BGR, which counted the defense contractor Raytheon and the Ukrainian government as clients until last year. Raytheon is part of a joint venture that manufactures Javelin antitank missiles, which the Trump administration agreed to supply to Ukraine. BGR said Volker recused himself from Ukraine government work at the firm when he started the special-envoy job.  Volker\u2019s statement casts the president\u2019s reluctance to meet with Zelensky as having little to do with Biden or Burisma but instead related to his \u201clong-held negative view towards Ukraine\u201d and Giuliani\u2019s assertion of Ukrainian malfeasance in the 2016 election. He cast himself as innocently working to improve the bilateral relationship and suggested that Trump\u2019s bigger focus was on persuading the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 election with a view to undermining the case that the Russians had interfered on his behalf.  In a text message ahead of the July 25 phone call, Volker told an adviser to Zelensky: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow \u2014 kurt.\u201d  However, it is clear from the text messages Volker knew by Aug. 10 that a renewed investigation of Burisma, the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board, along with a probe of Ukraine and the Democrats during the 2016 election, were viewed in Kiev as a quid pro quo for the Ukrainian president to secure a date for a White House summit with Trump.  \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations,\u201d Andrey Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, wrote in an Aug. 10 message to Volker.  \u201cSounds great!\u201d Volker responded.  [Officials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting]  Volker and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, worked on a draft statement for the Ukrainians so they could satisfy Trump\u2019s demands. After sending it to Giuliani, who wanted an explicit reference to Burisma and the 2016 election investigation, the two messaged back and forth to work up the text to send back to the Ukrainians, according to Volker. The Ukrainians ultimately did not agree to the statement upon receiving that version.  Volker said that Zelensky\u2019s aide replied by saying that the Ukrainian government did not want to mention Burisma and the 2016 election directly. Volker said he agreed with their decision and said he reiterated it was essential Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in the 2020 election. Zelensky\u2019s aide agreed, Volker said, \u201cand the idea of putting out a statement was shelved.\u201d  Suggesting language to send back to the Ukrainians in a later August text, Volker wrote to Sondland: \u201cWe intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\u201d  \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s send to Andrey after our call,\u201d Sondland replied, referring to Yermak by his first name.  Volker also pleaded ignorance of Trump\u2019s July 25 call in which he raised investigating Burisma and Biden with Zelensky, saying he received a general readout of the conversation from people who described it as a \u201cgood, congratulatory call.\u201d He said he learned the full details about the call only when it was released late last month.", "company": "washingtonpost"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T18:03:00", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hong-kong-leader-invokes-colonial-era-emergency-powers-to-ban-masks-as-protests-swell/2019/10/04/8c11f2d0-e5e6-11e9-b0a6-3d03721b85ef_story.html", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin", "October At Pm"], "title": "Hong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks, sparking more protests", "text": "  Anti-government office workers attend a lunchtime protest in Hong Kong on Friday after local media reported an expected ban on face masks under emergency law. (Tyrone Siu/Reuters)  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked rarely used and sweeping emergency powers Friday to ban face masks at demonstrations, a move that sought to quell pro-democracy protests \u2014 but that quickly had the opposite effect, intensifying anger on the streets.  Lam\u2019s decision to use colonial-era security powers further inflamed tensions roiling since June and heightened fears that Hong Kong\u2019s basic freedoms were being eroded. The order effectively expands police powers of arrest, even as many in Hong Kong fear that police are operating with impunity in their growing use of force.  It could also risk tainting Hong Kong\u2019s hard-won reputation as an open financial hub, already under strain because of the upheaval of recent months.  \u201cProtesters\u2019 violence has been escalating and has reached a very alarming level in the past few days, causing numerous injuries and leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panicked situation,\u201d Lam said in a news conference. Behind her, a banner read: \u201cTreasure Hong Kong, End Violence.\u201d  \u201cAs a responsible government, we have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calm in society,\u201d she said.  Lam added that while the emergency ordinance is being enacted to ban the masks, Hong Kong itself was not in a state of emergency but instead an in \u201coccasion of serious danger\u201d that required such laws.  Critics were quick to reject the measure and the use of emergency laws, citing a variety of reasons, the most fundamental being predictions that it won\u2019t work.  On Friday night, a crowd of thousands peacefully marched more than three miles through the city in opposition to the announcement and to the government. The demonstration later turned violent in several districts, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs and setting fire to symbolic targets such Chinese banks and subway stations.  The Hong Kong Hospital Authority said a 14-year-old boy had been shot in the thigh.  Police said a plainclothes officer had fired one shot in self-defense against a \u201clarge group of rioters\u201d who threw a gasoline bomb at the officer, lighting his body on fire.  \u201cWe should be prepared for the worst,\u201d said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker. Tien said he urged Lam and authorities in Beijing to offer a concession to the protest movement along with the ban, which he characterized as pushed by the police.  \u201cWhile giving the police the anti-mask law they wanted, secure from them the acceptance of an [independent investigation] into the force,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all stick and no carrot.\u201d  The ban was put in place at midnight local time. It applies to rallies that have been given a go-ahead by police, as well as those that are unauthorized. The law authorizes a police officer to order the removal of facial coverings and take them off forcefully if the person does not comply. Noncompliance would be punishable by a fine or a jail term of up to a year.  [For many in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s troops are already here: The Hong Kong Police Force]  Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of Hong Kong\u2019s executive council, said in an interview that such a ban should have come earlier in response to violence that has become \u201ctotally unjustifiable.\u201d  \u201cFreedom to express their views is not absolute,\u201d she said of the protesters. \u201cThese people are interfering with our freedoms.\u201d  The mask ban was also pushed by a more hardcore group of Beijing loyalists within Lam\u2019s government who have accused her of being too soft on the unrest roiling the city.    In central Hong Kong, thousands of protesters filled the streets at lunchtime in a demonstration that continued into the evening after work hours. The protesters \u2014 some in heels or suits \u2014 left high-rise offices to join the march. Almost all of them wore masks.  \u201cThis is adding fuel to the fire,\u201d Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said of the mask ban. \u201cThe result is clear. This will mark the beginning of riots in Hong Kong.\u201d  Lam\u2019s announcement came three days after widespread demonstrations across Hong Kong on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 rallies that degenerated into street battles between protesters and police. Officers fired at protesters multiple times, using live ammunition for the first time since the demonstrations erupted in June.  One protester was shot in the chest by an officer at close range after a group of protesters attacked police. The incident sparked even more demonstrations this week. The 18-year-old student, who remains hospitalized, was charged Thursday with rioting and assaulting a police officer. Police have said the shooting was justified.  [Hong Kong protester shot as police disperse anti-China demonstrations on National Day]  Beijing appeared to support the mask ban. Yang Guang, spokesman for China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said the chaotic situation there \u201ccannot continue endlessly.\u201d    Protests began over a bill to allow extraditions to mainland China that many feared would erode the city\u2019s freedoms and the independence of its reputable legal system. They have since swelled into an all-out rebuke of Hong Kong\u2019s political system, in which leaders are handpicked by and answerable to Beijing.  Demonstrators are pushing five demands, including an independent investigation of the police, but the government has responded only to one, the full withdrawal of the extradition bill.  On one major thoroughfare Friday, protesters marched down a four-lane road chanting \u201cFight back, Hong Kong!\u201d and \u201cFight for freedom!\u201d The march brought traffic to a halt, but some drivers stuck in the jam held up five fingers \u2014 a symbol of the five demands of protesters \u2014 outside the windows of their luxury sedans, beeping their horns in a show of support.  Penny, 35, who said he had worked in finance for 10 years, challenged police to use force against workers like him marching in the city center.  \u201cIf the police dare to shoot us in Central during midday, come on and do it. Don\u2019t be a coward,\u201d he said, like others using only his first name, for fear of retribution. \u201cIf Carrie Lam wants a police state, that is fine. We are not afraid.\u201d  Others expressed fears that Lam\u2019s move was only the beginning of what would be an increasingly repressive crackdown on dissent. Lam has said repeatedly that a solution to the political crisis can be reached through dialogue. She held a community listening session last month, but the move failed to win her any support.  \u201cThis is only the first step. In the coming weeks and months, [the government] will continue to use more force to push protesters not to voice any opposition,\u201d said Justin, 27, a corporate finance worker wearing a respirator, yellow construction helmet and goggles with tailored dress pants and a fitted shirt.  [Masks, cash and apps: How Hong Kong\u2019s protesters find ways to outwit the surveillance state]  Separately on Friday, the Education Bureau sent a letter to schools telling them to warn students not to wear masks inside or outside school, other than for religious or health purposes. \u201cSchools are not a place to express your political views,\u201d the letter said.  Students have been a major force in the recent protests and make up a large share of the more than 2,000 people arrested in street demonstrations. They have also organized class boycotts and other shows of solidarity inside the classroom.  The emergency powers, which date to 1922 when Hong Kong was under British colonial rule, allow authorities to censor the media; seize property; take control of all transportation, manufacturing and trade in the city; and detain people for lengthy periods.  Some legal experts say the emergency powers are not in line with Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, which grants the city its cherished freedoms, including the right to assembly.  Eric Cheung, a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, said the use of the emergency ordinance to enact the law was alarming.  \u201cIt sets a very bad and dangerous precedent in bypassing all of the normal legislative processes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you can now pass a law without any consultation, without any debate, without any public participation or voting by the Legislative Council.\u201d  He added that the move is \u201cvery, very damaging to Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cchanges the whole legal landscape.\u201d  Lam did not rule out enacting other regulations to curb protests, including a curfew.  Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s executive council and a legal adviser to Lam, said the decision was made because \u201csomething had to be done\u201d after the Tuesday shooting.  \u201cThere\u2019s lots of limitations all around, in terms of the kinds of decisions that the Hong Kong government can make. We just have to cross our fingers and hope that this decision can work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not being done with ill will. It is being done with the best interests of Hong Kong at heart.\u201d  Tiffany Liang contributed to this report.

Schiff (D-Calif.) has said that Congress is particularly interested in finding the records of Trump\u2019s calls with Putin, especially if they had been stored in an unorthodox way. The Kremlin initially said it did not want the conversations made public, though Putin said Wednesday that he would not be against it.  AD  AD  Accounts of Trump\u2019s private conversations with other senior Russian officials have already drawn criticism, including one in the Oval Office in 2017 in which Trump said he was unconcerned about Kremlin election interference. The remarks prompted the White House to limit access to the remarks, former officials told The Washington Post.  Below is a timeline of what is publicly known about Trump and Putin\u2019s conversations through phone calls and in person.  Jan. 28, 2017  Trump and Putin shared a congratulatory call after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A White House readout of the call said that it lasted about an hour and included discussions about Syria and the threat posed by the Islamic State and that the \u201cpositive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\u201d  AD  AD  According to subsequent reporting from Reuters, Putin raised the possibility of extending a 2010 treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads. Trump asked aides what the treaty, known as New START, was before denouncing it, Reuters reported.  April 3, 2017  Trump called Putin after a terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg subway. According to the White House readout, Trump \u201cexpressed his deepest condolences to the victims and their loved ones, and to the Russian people.\u201d  May 2, 2017  Trump and Putin spoke by phone about Syria and North Korea, according to the White House.  July 7, 2017  The two leaders meet for the first time in person on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. The meeting was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and interpreters, who later told reporters that the meeting had lasted two hours and covered the war in Syria.  AD  AD  The Post later reported that Trump had taken the unusual step of taking notes from his own interpreter after the meeting and instructing the employee not to discuss the details of the meeting, effectively limiting the amount of information other officials could learn about the meeting.  Trump also informally spoke with Putin at a dinner for the G-20 leaders later in the day. The U.S. president approached his Russian counterpart, and the only other party to the conversation was Putin\u2019s interpreter, according to officials present.  Nov. 11, 2017  Though the White House said there would be no formal meeting between Trump and Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Danang, Vietnam, the U.S. president later said he had spoken to the Russian leader informally at the event.  AD  Trump said he had \u201ctwo or three\u201d brief conversations with Putin that mostly centered on the war in Syria and Russian election interference. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One.  AD  Nov. 21, 2017  Trump and Putin spoke for an hour on the phone about the U.S.-Russia relationship and the conflict in Syria, according to the White House.  Dec. 14, 2017  Trump spoke with Putin on the phone to thank him for \u201cacknowledging America\u2019s strong economic performance in his annual press conference,\u201d according to the White House, which said the pair also talked about North Korea.  Dec. 17, 2017  Putin called Trump to thank him for the warning that U.S. intelligence agencies gave Russia about a terrorist plot in St. Petersburg, according to the White House.  AD  \u201cPresident Putin extended his thanks and congratulations to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo and the CIA,\u201d the readout said. \u201cPresident Trump then called Director Pompeo to congratulate him, his very talented people, and the entire intelligence community on a job well done!\u201d  AD  Feb. 12, 2018  Trump called Putin to offer his condolences after a plane crash in Russia killed 71 people, according to the White House, which also said that the two leaders discussed the Israel-Palestinian peace process and North Korea.  March 20, 2018  Trump called Putin after his reelection to the Russian presidency to congratulate him, according to the White House. The Post later reported that Trump had been given briefing notes that warned him \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d before the call.  AD  A week later, the Kremlin said that Trump had proposed meeting Putin at the White House for the Russian leader\u2019s first visit since 2005.  July 16, 2018  Trump and Putin met face-to-face again for a bilateral summit in Helsinki. The two leaders spoke for two hours, joined only by their interpreters, before holding a 46-minute news conference in which Trump said that Putin had made an \u201cextremely strong and powerful\u201d denial that Russia interfered with the U.S. election.  AD  A full account of what was discussed in the private meeting has never been offered, despite lawmakers\u2019 attempts to get interpreters\u2019 notes from the discussion.  Limited and sometimes contradictory accounts of the talks have leaked out. According to The Post, John Bolton, national security adviser at the time, told senior officials that Trump had told Putin that U.S. troops would stay in Syria until Iranians left. Kremlin officials have spoken of \u201cagreements\u201d reached during the meeting, without going into specifics.  AD  Nov. 30, 2018  Trump and Putin were both at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, but the U.S. president canceled a planned meeting just hours after the Kremlin had announced it, blaming the decision on Russia\u2019s seizure of Ukrainian naval ships and sailors in the Black Sea.  However, the Financial Times later reported that the two world leaders and their wives had talked for 15 minutes at an event at the Buenos Aires opera house. An unnamed Russian official told the newspaper that the discussion had been about whether they could meet formally, as well as the situations in Ukraine and Syria, and that only a Russian interpreter was present.  AD  May 3, 2019  Trump told reporters that he and Putin discussed the end of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election during a phone call but that he didn\u2019t tell Putin not to interfere in the next election.  AD  Then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters earlier in the day that the call lasted slightly more than an hour and also included discussion of nuclear agreements, North Korea, Venezuela and trade.  June 28, 2019  Trump met with Putin one the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The two leaders met for 90 minutes, mostly without journalists present. Russian state media reported that Putin invited Trump to Moscow to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2020.  Before the private meeting, Trump was asked by journalists whether he would warn Putin not to interfere in future U.S. elections, prompting the U.S. president to jokingly reprimand the Kremlin leader. \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election,\u201d Trump said while wagging a finger.  July 31, 2019  Trump and Putin spoke by phone to discuss wildfires in Siberia and trade between the two nations, according to the White House.

A Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said the meeting occurred Thursday and lasted more than an hour. A former Taliban member in Kabul who maintains close ties to the group\u2019s leadership confirmed that the meeting took place. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subject with the media.

Before talks were called off last month, they were aimed at reaching a peace deal under which the United States would withdraw its forces from Afghanistan in exchange for a pledge from Taliban leadership to cut ties with al-Qaeda and support counterterrorism efforts.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)  An announcement of a peace deal appeared to be imminent until Trump abruptly scuttled talks on Sept. 7. Trump said the decision was made after a Taliban attack that resulted in the death of an American service member on Sept. 5.  But in the days that followed, officials in Kabul and Washington cautioned that talks were likely on hold rather than entirely scrapped. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to signal as much when he told Fox News in a Sept. 8 interview that the negotiations were off \u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Khalilzad arrived in Pakistan earlier this week, and Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid announced Wednesday that a delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would also travel to Pakistan. Baradar is a co-founder of the Taliban movement and was a lead negotiator throughout talks with Khalilzad.  Video released by Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry showed Taliban leaders embracing ministry officials as they arrived in Islamabad for meetings. Pakistan has urged both sides to resume peace talks, and the Taliban has said it remains open to talks with the United States.  Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said in a statement Wednesday that the \u201cagenda for discussions\u201d with Pakistani officials included \u201cissues of restoration of peace and security in the region.\u201d The statement made no mention of talks with Americans.  A State Department spokesperson said Wednesday that Khalilzad was in Pakistan \u201cfor consultations with authorities in Pakistan\u201d to follow up on discussions held between Trump and Prime Minister Imran Khan at the U.N. General Assembly last week. The spokesperson was not authorized to discuss the trip on the record and released the statement on the condition of anonymity.  After meeting with Taliban leaders Thursday, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Islamabad and the Taliban \u201cagreed on the need for \u2026 resumption of the peace process.\u201d  It is \u201ctime to make all possible efforts for an early, peaceful resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The statement also warned that \u201cbroad regional and international consensus for achieving peace in Afghanistan \u2026 provided an unprecedented opportunity that must not be lost.\u201d  Shaiq Hussain in Islamabad and Sayed Salahuddin in Kabul contributed to this report.

Although the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing \u201cto launch politically motivated investigations,\u201d top Democrats said in statement Thursday night.  \u201cheard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker texted Zelensky\u2019s aide, Andrey Yermak, on July 25, hours before Trump and the Ukrainian president spoke via phone. The rough transcript of that conversation was released by the White House last week.  AD  AD  Whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office  Yet two weeks after that call, the president still had not agreed to meet with Zelensky \u2014 and administration officials sought to convince the Ukrainians that Trump would need a public pledge before agreeing to the meeting, according to the text messages.  \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland texted to Volker on Aug. 9, noting that Zelensky might give a news conference announcing his intent to investigate. \u201cTo avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement (embargoed) so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover.\u201d  By the next day, the Ukrainians had agreed to announce their plans to carry out Trump\u2019s investigations alongside the date for a meeting between the two heads of state, the messages indicate.  AD  AD  \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d Yermak texted Volker on Aug. 10. Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, sat on the board of Burisma for five years.  But Trump never committed to a meeting. And as the United States resisted giving Zelensky an audience with Trump, administration officials\u2019 discussions suggest the White House was issuing an escalating series of demands.  \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d U.S. Charges D\u2019affaires in Ukraine William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor texted to Sondland on Sept. 1, after Trump skipped a trip to Poland where he was meant to visit with Zelensky. Sondland swiftly moved the conversation from text messages to a phone call.  AD  AD  \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor later texted Sondland on Sept. 9, complaining that the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine had already created a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d  \u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland replied. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that president zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d  Sondland declined to comment through an attorney, Jim McDermott. Volker did not respond to requests for comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to messages, nor did the White House.  AD  AD  The abrupt end to the texts mirrors the current political climate on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans are fiercely divided over whether Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky into investigating Burisma and the 2016 elections were proper diplomacy or an abuse of power.  House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that Volker had provided \u201cample evidence\u201d to show that it was a \u201crequirement\u201d that Zelensky launch the 2016 elections investigation to \u201cexonerate Russia\u2019s role,\u201d and that the focus on Burisma was to investigate Biden. \u201cThat was an understood predicate for the meeting,\u201d Swalwell said.  But House Republicans emerged from Volker\u2019s day-long deposition saying that nothing Volker had said damaged the president and that there was no proof Trump had sought a quid pro quo. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump\u2019s most aggressive defenders, said on Twitter that \u201cthe facts we learned today from Ambassador Volker undercut the salacious narrative that @RepAdamSchiff is using to sell his impeachment ambitions.\u201d  AD  AD  Schiff, a California Democrat, is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and leading the impeachment inquiry.  Volker is the first of several State Department officials expected to give congressional investigators an inside account of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to press for a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, who, as a leading 2020 Democratic candidate to challenge Trump for the White House, has become a fixed target of the president\u2019s attacks.  At the heart of Trump\u2019s effort is the contention of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that as vice president, Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, as part of a corrupt plot to halt investigations of Burisma.  AD  Volker told House investigators on Thursday that he had warned Giuliani against trusting the information he was receiving from Ukrainian political figures about Joe Biden and his son. He said he tried to caution Giuliani that his Ukrainian sources were unreliable and that he should be careful about putting faith in their theories, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.  AD  But the texts show that Volker also introduced Giuliani to Yermak, so that the two could speak on July 22 and better facilitate direct contacts between Trump and Zelensky.  Zelensky was \u201csensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d Taylor had texted Sondland on July 21. Sondland replied that he was more \u201cworried about the alternative\u201d if Trump and Zelensky did not speak to \u201cget the conversation started and the relationship built.\u201d  AD  \u201cMost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help the investigation,\u201d Volker had informed Sondland on July 19, according to the text messages.  Giuliani had been \u201cadvocating\u201d for Trump and Zelensky to speak by phone on July 25, Volker\u2019s texts show. In an interview Thursday night, Giuliani said he also knew of conversations between U.S. and Ukrainian officials about a statement that would commit the Ukrainian president to investigate Burisma. But he insisted that \u201cto my knowledge, it was never put out.\u201d  AD  Giuliani also said that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d ever being told by Volker that his claims were spurious. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain he never said that the claims weren\u2019t true, because I would have jumped all over him and asked him what kind of investigation he\u2019d done and how he knew that,\u201d Giuliani said of Volker.  AD  Joe Biden and his defenders have denied Giuliani\u2019s accusations and noted that Biden\u2019s push to remove Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general, was part of a broader international effort that included the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, where leaders viewed Shokin as inept.  Volker also told lawmakers Thursday that he and other State Department officials cautioned the Ukrainians to steer clear of U.S. politics. Getting involved, he said he told them, would open the nation to allegations that it was interfering in an American election and could be detrimental to Ukraine long-term, according to the people familiar with his testimony.  AD  House investigators asked Volker whether efforts to pressure the Ukrainians included withholding a \u00adleader-level meeting with Zelensky and about $400 million in military aid from the country, those familiar with the meeting said.  Volker acknowledged, these people said, that the Trump administration had extended an invitation to Zelensky shortly after his election in the spring and that it was later withdrawn. Volker told House investigators that Trump\u2019s delay in meeting Zelensky and the decision to halt military aid deeply concerned Ukrainian officials, who view Washington as a critical ally against Russia, the people familiar with his testimony said.  Trump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president, officials say  Volker said Thursday that he was never given an explanation about the aid suspension.  Volker started his job at the State Department in 2017 in an unusual part-time arrangement that allowed him to continue consulting at BGR, a powerful lobbying firm that represents Ukraine and the U.S.-based defense firm Raytheon. During his tenure, Volker advocated for the United States to send Raytheon-manufactured antitank Javelin missiles to Ukraine \u2014 a decision that made Raytheon millions of dollars. BGR has said Volker recused himself from all Ukraine-related matters in response to criticisms about conflicts of interest.  On Thursday afternoon, the State Department announced that it had approved the sale of 150 additional Javelin missiles to Ukraine for up to $39.2 million and notified Congress.  Volker also kept his job as executive director of the McCain Institute, an affiliation that may explain why Volker never penetrated Trump\u2019s inner circle, given the president\u2019s open disdain for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died last year.  Previously, Volker served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration.

But across Latin America, restrictions remain widespread.", "text": "Uruguay, Cuba and certain parts of Mexico allow abortion, though gestational limits vary. The majority of Latin American countries, however, allow abortions only in the case of rape or if the life or health of the woman is at risk. Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Suriname have total bans on abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.  AD  Activists pushing to change the status quo haven\u2019t always succeeded. But they see a growing movement that can push lawmakers toward progress on this front.  AD  \u201cThere is no doubt that Latin America is moving forward on reproductive rights. On one side, most of the countries in the region have had discussions on abortion in the past 20 years and countries like Colombia, Chile and Guyana abolished their total bans on abortion,\u201d said Catalina Mart\u00ednez Coral, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights.  \u201cThere are complex challenges, as well. Fundamentalist religious groups are pushing a political agenda against sexual and reproductive rights,\u201d she said.  AD  Here\u2019s a rundown of key countries in the region.  Mexico  The weekend\u2019s protests in Mexico followed news that lawmakers in the state of Oaxaca had voted to decriminalize abortion.  \u201cVotes such as the one in Oaxaca encourage the women\u2019s movement around the region to promote legal changes,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said.  AD  Abortion laws in Mexico are enacted at the state level. Abortion has been legal in Mexico City since 2007, but most states in the country allow the procedure only if the life of the woman is in danger. After the weekend demonstrations, the country\u2019s ruling party announced Monday that it would present a bill in Congress to decriminalize abortion at the federal level. Though states would still have the final say, if the law is enacted, women could access abortion in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy at federally run hospitals.  AD  Argentina  Argentina\u2019s abortion rights activists suffered a blow in 2018 when a bill to legalize abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy failed to clear the Senate. The decision was the culmination of months of protests to lift restrictions. Argentine law allows abortion only in cases of rape or if the woman\u2019s health is in danger.  AD  Even women and girls who are eligible under the law struggle to find access to abortion.  In February, the issue returned to the spotlight when a 11-year-old rape victim was denied an abortion despite the statute. The girl, called \u201cLucia\u201d to protect her identity, begged officials for an abortion, asking them to \u201cremove what the old man put inside me.\u201d She had been assaulted by the 65-year-old partner of her grandmother.  AD  Instead she was forced to undergo a Caesarean section 23 weeks into her term.  The news outraged activists, who said her abortion was denied to further the political agenda of the governor of the province in which she lived.  Now there is a renewed push to legalize abortion in Argentina, the birthplace of Pope Francis, with protests and a new bill ahead of a presidential election later this month.  AD  Ecuador  As in Argentina, abortion rights campaigns in Ecuador have been prominent but unsuccessful. Abortion is legal in Ecuador if the pregnancy poses a danger to the health of the woman or if a woman who is mentally disabled is raped. In September, protests erupted after a bill that would decriminalize abortion for all rape victims failed to clear the national assembly.  AD  Abortion rights activists said the bill\u2019s rejection would endanger lives. According to the Health Ministry, in 2014, women seeking illegal abortions accounted for 15.6 percent of maternal deaths.  El Salvador  El Salvador has one of the world\u2019s strictest abortion laws. While Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Suriname and Haiti also have total bans on abortion, El Salvador\u2019s legal system goes a step further, making it possible to charge a woman with aggravated homicide if she has an abortion.  AD  As a result, women serve decades-long prison terms under this statute. Many of them say they were accused of having abortions even though they had miscarriages.  AD  While some have been acquitted in the past year, others have not been as fortunate.  In September, officials announced they would retry Evelyn Beatr\u00edz Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz on counts of aggravated homicide for having an abortion, the country\u2019s first retrial in an abortion case. Hern\u00e1ndez was freed in February after serving 33 months of a 30-year sentence when an appeals judge said the prosecution did not provide adequate proof that she had intentionally terminated her pregnancy.  Hern\u00e1ndez was found passed out, bleeding heavily, in an outhouse in 2016, having given birth to a stillborn baby boy.

The prospects for a breakthrough this weekend remain fraught given the wide gulf after negotiations broke down during President Trump\u2019s second summit with Kim in February in Hanoi. But the ease and regularity with which Kim and his top aides have hopscotched the globe over the past 18 months have scrambled international consensus on how to deal with a pariah state once known as the \u201cHermit Kingdom.\u201d  Kim, who had not traveled beyond North Korea\u2019s borders since taking power in late 2011, signaled a turn to international engagement by dispatching his sister and other top aides to the Winter Olympics in Seoul in February 2018. Since then, the 35-year-old ruler has orchestrated a dramatic global coming-out party punctuated by seven trips abroad to meet with five foreign leaders, including three meetings with Trump.  The speed with which Kim has established himself as a figure of international aplomb has frustrated Bolton, the ousted national security adviser, and other hawks who contend that Trump moved too quickly to reward a brutal dictator with personal attention and normalize him on the world stage, without securing enforceable commitments to denuclearize.  Last month, Kim reportedly invited Trump to visit Pyongyang, and although Trump told reporters that such a trip is premature, there is talk of another bilateral summit by year\u2019s end. South Korean officials are said to be weighing an offer to Kim to participate in a gathering in November of Southeast Asian leaders in Busan, South Korea.  At a Washington think tank on Monday, Bolton declared that Kim would never willingly relinquish his arsenal and suggested that the United States consider strategies to force regime change or conduct a first-strike military attack. \u201cThese are questions that need to focus our attention,\u201d Bolton said, \u201cnot can we get another summit with Kim Jong Un.\u201d  Trump\u2019s allies discounted Bolton as a warmonger and countered that the president was right to reject decades of fruitless U.S. policy to isolate and punish the Kim regime. They cited reduced bilateral tensions as evidence that the president\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox approach is paying dividends, even though North Korea has unsettled its neighbors with short-range missile tests since the summer.  \u201cI cannot understand for the life of me that the establishment in D.C. thinks it doesn\u2019t make sense to talk to a nation\u2019s leader in order to do diplomacy,\u201d said Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served as senior director for strategy in Trump\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cThe diplomacy is in addition to [economic] sanctions. To the extent that it ratchets down tensions and creates the ability for continuous dialogue, who knows if that can lead over time to a softening of attitudes.\u201d  Outside experts said there is little doubt that Kim has succeeded in his goal of gaining a measure of global legitimacy that had once been unimaginable \u2014 a valuable domestic propaganda tool for a young leader determined to consolidate power and ensure his future standing.  In addition to Trump, Kim has met abroad with China\u2019s Xi Jinping, South Korea\u2019s Moon Jae-in, Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin, Singapore\u2019s Lee Hsien Loong and Vietnam\u2019s Nguyen Phu Trong \u2014 trips attended by the kind of red-carpet pageantry, local crowds and international news media attention reserved for global dignitaries.  Images of Kim being feted by his hosts have been disseminated by North Korean state media even as reports of the breakdown in nuclear negotiations have placed blame on the United States.  \u201cHe can tell his people that he met with the world\u2019s most powerful leaders and take that propaganda and use it to justify his policies,\u201d said Jean H. Lee, a former Associated Press reporter who served as bureau chief in Pyongyang from 2008 to 2013. \u201cThat makes it very hard to challenge him or raise any criticism and allows him to maintain very tough policies on his people.\u201d  Despite Kim\u2019s pledges to shift focus from North Korea\u2019s weapons development to economic growth, the nation continues to face food shortages amid tough international sanctions, and Kim operates some of the harshest forced-labor camps in the world.  But since his sister, Kim Yo-Jong, led North Korea\u2019s delegation to the Opening Ceremonies of the Winter Games in Seoul last year, the family\u2019s trips have been met with breathless coverage that often glosses over the regime\u2019s brutality.  For all the viral social media focus on oddities that reflected Kim\u2019s security paranoia \u2014 such as the body guards who jogged next to Kim\u2019s limousine at a summit with Moon in April 2018 or the green, armored train that ferried him on a leisurely 60-hour trip to the second summit with Trump in Hanoi in February \u2014 there are juxtaposing scenes that revealed a young leader who has carefully crafted the messaging behind his charm offensive.  Kim conducted a late-evening tour of Singapore\u2019s glittering skyline in June 2018, including stops at the 55-story Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Jubilee Bridge. He answered shouted questions from U.S. journalists in Hanoi in February and engaged a Russian state television reporter upon arriving at the Vladivostok train station in April. And he grasped hands with Trump to welcome him across the 38th parallel into North Korean territory during their hastily arranged meeting at the Korean demilitarized zone in June.  \u201cTrump meeting and shaking hands made it possible for everyone else to as well,\u201d said Katie Stallard-Blanchette, a Wilson Center fellow who worked as a television correspondent in East Asia.  White House aides have emphasized that Trump has not lifted punishing economic sanctions even as he has engaged in diplomacy with Kim. To Stallard-Blanchette, Kim\u2019s success in reestablishing diplomatic norms has been accompanied by something perhaps more alarming \u2014 a normalization of missile tests.  Kim has maintained a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing for nearly two years, but the regime\u2019s short-range projectile launches since the summer included a new type of submarine-based ballistic missile that landed in waters off Japan this week. Trump has not commented on that test, even as it drew objections from Tokyo and Seoul.  \u201cIf we went back 18 months and they tested a submarine missile on the eve of talks with the U.S., the next thing is the talks would be canceled,\u201d Stallard-Blanchette said. \u201cNow there\u2019s really no response [from the United States]. That gives Kim a very positive sense of where the line is. . . . He\u2019s marching forward all the time to redefine what\u2019s normal. That\u2019s what\u2019s dangerous.\u201d", "company": "washingtonpost"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T05:59:44", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/trumps-impeachment-battle-is-part-of-a-bigger-global-crisis-in-democracy/2019/10/04/c208383c-e5d8-498a-9a80-a62597efa81b_story.html", "authors": ["Ishaan Tharoor", "Reporter Covering Foreign Affairs", "Geopolitics", "October At Am"], "title": "Trump\u2019s impeachment battle is part of a bigger global crisis in democracy", "text": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions? Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.  President Trump is cornered and lashing out. Just this week, he has demanded the arrest of political rivals, raged about a \u201ccoup\u201d against him and kept firing his incessant fusillades at the \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d press. Trump sees the impending congressional impeachment inquiry as a \u201choax\u201d; most sober analysts believe House Democrats now have a clear-cut case to prove the president\u2019s abuse of power, as evidence of Trump seeking to pressure a foreign government into giving him dirt on a domestic opponent keeps piling up. On Thursday, in front of cameras and reporters on the White House lawn, he openly called on governments in Ukraine and China to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family.  But Trump may hope the atmospherics of the showdown \u2014 rather than the facts \u2014 are still in his favor. Backed by the United States\u2019 right-wing media, Trump intends to hunker down in America\u2019s polarized battlefield and fight for his survival, even if that means dragging the country\u2019s institutions into the morass. The bulk of Republican politicians remain too afraid to turn against him, while administration officials and federal bureaucrats see their personal fate tethered to his moods.  ELECTION INTERFERENCE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2019  \u201cThe implicit day-to-day charge for many Trump advisers is simple,\u201d reported my colleagues at the White House. \u201cFigure out how to handle or even polish Trump\u2019s whims and statements, but do not have any illusion that you can temper his relentless personality, heavy consumption of cable news or thirst for political combat.\u201d  Trump\u2019s disregard for long-standing norms leaves U.S. politics in a somewhat unfamiliar place. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes have this problem all the time \u2026 when all government activity is the product of the id of the leader,\u201d Timothy Naftali, a historian and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, told my colleagues. \u201cBut in a republic, that\u2019s unusual.\u201d  If there is central theme to the age of Trump, it\u2019s precisely that: What was unusual in sophisticated republican democracies is becoming increasingly commonplace. And not just in the United States. The impeachment saga convulsing Washington \u2014 where an embattled leader is calling into question the very legitimacy of those opponents challenging his conduct \u2014 has, to a certain extent, analogues elsewhere.  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Trump ally, complained of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d launched by his rivals as the country\u2019s attorney general pursues possible corruption charges against him. In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2014 who came to power this year via the votes of a fraction of a fraction of the British public \u2014 smeared members of Parliament thwarting Brexit as agents of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal.\u201d In India, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, the country\u2019s Hindu nationalist leaders routinely cast their rivals as \u201canti-national\u201d liberals who ought to move to Pakistan.  On both sides of the pond, talk of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories is rife, often with an all-too-familiar undertone. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, laid the impeachment inquiry at the feet of Jewish financier George Soros \u2014 whose support of liberal causes over the years has made him a frequent target of anti-Semites and nativists. On Thursday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, an influential Brexiteer and current leader of the House of Commons, conspiratorially cited Soros as a supposed enemy of Brexit and backer of its British opponents. The remarks led to calls from Jewish politicians in Britain for Rees-Mogg to resign.  George Soros as a sinister international Jewish puppetmaster is the classic antisemitic trope of our time. If Jacob Rees Mogg didn't know that, he is a disturbingly ignorant man. If he does know, then where do you even begin. pic.twitter.com/iRSDe59ayg \u2014 Owen Jones\ud83c\udf39 (@OwenJones84) October 3, 2019  There are immediate consequences to such demagoguery, not least in the form of far-right terrorist attacks and violence carried out by people inflamed by this sort of rhetoric. But there\u2019s also a long-term toll, one that\u2019s more imperceptible, yet no less corrosive, to the body politic. It\u2019s the kind of erosion on display in places such as Hungary, Poland and Turkey, where majoritarian, nationalist politicians have steadily undermined democratic institutions and the liberal norms they\u2019re supposed to uphold.  \u201cThe death of democracy is now typically administered in a thousand cuts,\u201d wrote the Stanford political scientist Larry Diamond earlier this year. \u201cIn one country after another, elected leaders have gradually attacked the deep tissues of democracy \u2014 the independence of the courts, the business community, the media, civil society, universities and sensitive state institutions like the civil service, the intelligence agencies and the police.\u201d  You don\u2019t need to look further than Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline. The president has lambasted any federal agency, independent civic institution or media organization he sees working against him, even when their employees can only be accused of doing the job they are supposed to do. State-appointed judges are either his judges or enemies. Journalists who say nice things about Trump are good; those who don\u2019t are \u201cfake.\u201d Law enforcement officials posing next to Trump along the southern border are heroes, but those investigating Trump\u2019s campaign or using internal channels to voice their alarm over his dealings are traitors.  Diamond placed Trump at the center of \u201cAmerica\u2019s own political decay\u201d and observed how the president\u2019s excusing of \u201ca grim list of dictators\u201d abroad and embrace of nativist politics at home had \u201cshaken the post-World War II liberal order.\u201d He also blamed political cynicism on both sides of the aisle, \u201ccalcified systems that don\u2019t deliver public goods and complacent citizens who cannot bestir themselves to vote.\u201d  As myriad analysts have already argued, Trump is not a sui generis figure, but a symptom of American politics and, in particular, of the radicalization of the American right. \u201cThe GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics,\u201d wrote political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein in a prescient piece long ago in 2012. \u201cIt is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d  The uproar over impeachment may only underscore these hard-line positions. It gives Trump the fuel to drive an angry, resentful reelection campaign, and it reveals the frailties of an American system bound together by fraying civic understandings and aging conventions.  \u201cWhat makes Trump dangerous is that he exposes parts of liberal democracies that were only shadowily visible up until now,\u201d said Peter Sloterdijk, celebrity German philosopher and frequent critic of the left, in an interview with the New Yorker last year in which he spoke of the American president as a \u201cdegenerate sheriff,\u201d happy to flout the rules of the state he leads. \u201cIn democracies, there is always an oligarchic element, but Trump makes it extremely, comically visible.\u201d  Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?

A second security video, recorded from what appears to be a street-level parking garage, shows the red rope dangling from above. Eventually, Merlano drops to the ground. Passersby initially come to her aid, and she then can be seen hopping on the back of a motorbike; the driver hands her a helmet, and they both speed away.  On Thursday, Interpol announced it was issuing an orange notice to the international law enforcement community warning that Merlano represented a serious and imminent threat to public safety.

Justice Minister Margarita Cabello fired the women\u2019s prison head who authorized Merlano\u2019s dentist trip, reported Al Jazeera. Cabello also asked for the resignation of William Ruiz, who oversees Colombia\u2019s prison system.

The BBC reported that Merlano arrived at the Medical Center of La Sabana at 11:35 a.m. Tuesday, escorted by two female guards. A guard waited outside the room for three hours while Merlano saw the dentist. When the dentist left the room, the guard entered, only to find Merlano already gone, the BBC reported.  In a statement, the medical center said it was notified at 3 p.m. of Merlano\u2019s escape. The former politician has not been since the escape.  Merlano, a former House representative in Colombia, won her Senate race last year but will not serve in the seat because of her criminal conviction.

(Wissm Al-Okili/Reuters)  Protests flared across Iraq on Thursday as authorities imposed curfews and cut access to the Internet, plunging the country into an information blackout.  As night fell, officials said at least 25 people had died and more than 1,000 were wounded after security forces fired tear gas and bullets into crowds of protesters for a third day and demonstrations continued in southern cities.  \u201cThe hospitals are filling up,\u201d said Ali al-Bayati, a spokesman for Iraq\u2019s human rights commission. Many people, he said, were in critical condition.  Iraq\u2019s widening protests have centered on issues that plague everyday life in the oil-rich state, including corruption, poor services and unemployment. For most civilians, there have been few improvements in the two years since Iraqi forces pushed Islamic State militants from major cities, and for many Iraqis, life is getting worse.  [Hundreds wounded in Iraq as police fire tear gas, bullets at protesters]  Much of the country woke to an indefinite curfew, declared early Thursday by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. Without the Internet, people gathered what news they could by phone, sending the rumor mill swirling.  In Baghdad, the violent crackdown appeared only to have drawn out more protestersto the streets. Several thousand demonstrators were gathered in the center of the city Thursday night. Helicopters circled low, hovering over clouds of tear gas as the sound of gunfire rang out. Protesters piled the wounded into carts and drove off in a frantic race to the hospital.  Haider al-Lami, 29, said he had joined the protests because they appeared to have grown organically, rather than as the result of a call from political parties. \u201cThis is an uprising from the people who suffer. It represents them and only them,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope this can reform a broken system.\u201d  Abdul Mahdi\u2019s fragile year-old government has struggled to appoint ministers to key positions and to tackle graft that is siphoning money from public services and into the pockets of politically connected people. The corruption is so severe that economists now call it endemic. In Baghdad, one of the raised signs read: \u201cEnough.\u201d  In a televised speech Thursday night, Abdul Mahdi urged calm and called on lawmakers to support him in reshuffling cabinet posts. There is no \u201cmagic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s chronic governance problems and graft, he said, but he pledged to try to pass a law granting poor families a basic income, the Reuters news agency reported.  Early Thursday, the U.S.-led coalition reported explosions inside or near the city\u2019s Green Zone, a heavily fortified pocket of land hosting government institutions, embassies and military bases.  \u201cNo coalition facility was struck. Coalition troops always reserve the right to defend ourselves; attacks on our personnel will not be tolerated,\u201d said U.S. Army Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a spokesman for the coalition.  There were also suggestions that political scores were being settled under the cover of the violence. Security officials reported Thursday that masked gunmen had burst into the house of high-profile activist and cartoonist Hussein Adel Madani, killing him and his wife, Sara Madani. Their 2-year-old daughter survived.  Iran\u2019s semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported Thursday that the unrest had forced the closure of two border crossings popular with Iranian pilgrims. Gen. Qasem Rezai, a commander of the country\u2019s border guards, said the Khosravi and Chazbeh crossings had been closed the night before.  Loveluck reported from London.

Coming from a nation that ranks second on the World Press Freedom Index \u2014 the United States ranks 48th \u2014 stunned Finnish reporters described to their readers back home a \u201ccircus\u201d and parallel reality in the White House.  Finnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet offered a blunt summary of the meeting: \u201cNiinisto\u2019s visit was overshadowed by Circus Trump \u2014 President Niinisto asked Trump to safeguard U.S. democracy.\u201d  \u201cIt was a very typical Trump news conference with a foreign leader. [Trump talks,] and the foreign leader is just a prop, who basically watches and tries to keep a straight face,\u201d Jussi Hanhimaki, a Finnish researcher focusing on transatlantic relations, told The Washington Post.  During the combative news conference Wednesday, Trump lashed out at the media, accusing journalists of undermining U.S. democracy and being \u201ccorrupt people.\u201d Responding to questions about a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president that is at the center of an impeachment inquiry, Trump told a reporter: \u201cIt\u2019s a whole hoax, and you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.\u201d  [Trump rides a roller coaster of grievances, victimhood and braggadocio as Finland\u2019s leader looks on]  Meanwhile, Niinisto largely looked on in silence. Photos of his bewildered face quickly circulated online. But when Trump began responding to a question addressed to Niinisto, the Finnish leader interrupted: \u201cI think the question is for me.\u201d  In what Finnish commentators suggested was a subtle dig at Trump, Niinisto at one point also said: \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on.\u201d (Trump appeared to interpret that remark as praise.)  But to Finnish observers, Hanhimaki said, it was as far as any leader would \u201cgo in terms of implying something about the U.S. president.\u201d  Mikko Saikku, a professor of American studies at the University of Helsinki, said that Niinisto is known for such ambiguous statements and that it is not unusual for him to keep his cool in an uncomfortable setting.  \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an easy place for him, with Trump raging about the investigation and impeachment and all that,\u201d Saikku said. \u201cHe was able to handle that quite well, and he was able to sweep in some of his trademark remarks.\u201d  Laura Saarikoski, managing editor of Finland\u2019s leading daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, said, \u201cQuite a few people couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for Niinisto when he had to sit there and try not to look too awkward.\u201d  At one point, as the two sat together in the Oval Office, Trump leaned over and slapped Niinisto\u2019s knee. Niinisto responded by raising his hand in a move that was widely interpreted as him brushing Trump away.  It seemed as though Niinisto \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be seen as being on the same side or joining what Trump was saying,\u201d Saarikoski said. \"He didn\u2019t want to be impolite but didn\u2019t want Trump to hold his knee.\u201d  Saarikoski, who was previously a U.S.-based correspondent for her newspaper and co-authored a book about Trump, said that even if Finns spent Thursday joking about it, there are \u201cserious undertones\u201d to his rhetoric.  \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a tactic from Trump that he always goes on these rages when he has a foreign head of state next to him,\u201d she said.  If Trump wants to address domestic concerns with American reporters, she said, \u201che could just hold a news conference and let out fumes while there with the U.S. press.\u201d  Finnish observers also took issue with Trump\u2019s treatment of the media.  \u201cIf Donald Trump shouted less, reporters might hear better,\u201d the Helsingin Sanomat commented, in a reference to the president\u2019s frequent criticism of media outlets for allegedly misquoting him.  The Aamulehti paper reminded its readers that a \u201cclash between Niinisto and the media,\u201d akin to Trump\u2019s confrontations with journalists, \u201cseems like a very distant, almost impossible thought,\u201d given Finland\u2019s high level of press freedom.  The Ilta-Sanomat tabloid described Trump\u2019s performance as \u201cperplexing.\u201d Meanwhile, a body language expert interviewed by the paper to decipher the tumultuous news conference described Niinisto as \u201crelaxed compared to Trump,\u201d as he was listening to what the Iltalehti tabloid described as \u201cTrump\u2019s quirky monologue\u201d in the Oval Office, before the news conference.  Other Finnish papers similarly applauded the Finnish president for handling his \u201crole of a bystander with honor,\u201d as Helsingin Sanomat wrote.  Besides the possibility of getting drawn into the domestic U.S. debate over an impeachment inquiry, Niinisto faced the risk of triggering Trump\u2019s anger over trade ties between the United States and the European Union. Niinisto\u2019s visit to the White House on Wednesday coincided with a ruling by the World Trade Organization that Trump can impose tariffs on about $7.5 billion worth of European goods because the European Union was found to have illegally subsidized aircraft manufacturer Airbus in the past. The ruling played into Trump\u2019s narrative that Europe\u2019s trade policies disadvantage U.S. companies.  \u201cNiinisto suddenly had to become the defender of the European Union, even though he was not expecting to be in that position,\u201d Hanhimaki said.  While Trump did reiterate that \u201ccountries were ripping off the United States for many years,\u201d his continuous attacks on Europe over trade policies largely went unnoticed amid his diatribes against the media and his opponents.  And there have been awkward moments between Trump and Niinisto before. In a 2017 joint news conference at the White House, Niinisto called on a Finnish journalist to offer her the chance to ask a question. Trump replied by suggesting that the Finnish leader was offering the same reporter a second chance at a question. \"Again?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give her \u2014 the same one?\u201d  Niinisto gently clarified that this was a different woman than the one he had called on before. \u201cWe have a lot of blond women in Finland,\u201d the reporter quipped with a smile.  This time, Trump wrapped up the news conference by calling it \u201can honor\u201d to be with Niinisto.  \u201cHe\u2019s done a fantastic job. Very popular, beloved over in Finland,\" he said.  And perhaps especially so after Wednesday, Finnish commentators suggested.  \u201cNiinisto is pretty popular, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever looked quite as good as compared to Trump last night,\u201d Saarikoski said.  And the Finnish leader himself suggested he enjoyed his stay in Washington, tweeting Thursday that in addition to meetings with Trump and Pence and a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, he visited three museums and roller-skated twice. Plus, the Washington Nationals baseball team won while he was in town.  \u201cPerfect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThanks Washington!\u201d  Read more:  Trump rides a roller coaster of grievances, victimhood and braggadocio as Finland\u2019s leader looks on  Odd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call  Trump involved Pence in efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader, though officials say vice president was unaware of allegations in whistleblower complaint", "company": "washingtonpost"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T17:36:00", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/eu-rejects-new-british-brexit-proposal-raising-prospect-of-chaotic-break-within-weeks/2019/10/03/ae551d60-e5df-11e9-b7da-053c79b03db8_story.html", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe"], "title": "E.U. rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposal, raising prospect of chaotic break within weeks", "text": "British negotiators plan to visit Brussels again Friday.

Parliament passed a law demanding that the prime minister request an extension if a withdrawal deal has not been agreed by mid-October. But Johnson has continued to insist that Britain will leave with or without a deal at the end of the month.  AD  AD  Johnson\u2019s most substantive plan so far, presented to E.U. leaders Wednesday, tries to address issues in Northern Ireland \u2014 the major barrier to a withdrawal agreement. But his written proposal crosses several E.U. red lines. Some policymakers assessed that it would be more damaging to the European Union than the economic and political instability that could come with an abrupt \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit without any transition period to buffer the way.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson offers a new Brexit plan, new suspension of Parliament  \u201cSafeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and E.U.\u2019s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,\u201d read a statement from the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit oversight committee. \u201cThe U.K. proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise\u201d by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May.  The European Parliament can veto any deal approved by the leaders of E.U. member states, who make up the European Council.  AD  AD  Many European leaders appear to be deferring \u2014 for now \u2014 to Ireland because of how directly it would be affected by the terms of a Brexit withdrawal.  \u201cThere are elements of this proposal that simply will not be part of any deal,\u201d Irish deputy leader Simon Coveney said Thursday.  European Council President Donald Tusk said he had spoken to both Ireland\u2019s and Britain\u2019s leaders Thursday. \u201cWe stand fully behind Ireland,\u201d he tweeted. To Johnson, he said, \u201cWe remain open but still unconvinced.\u201d  There was similar skepticism from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body.  \u201cThere are problematic points in the U.K.\u2019s proposal, and further work is needed,\u201d said European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud.  AD  Although British Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had admonished that the ball was in the European Union\u2019s court, Bertaud emphasized, \u201cThis work is for the U.K. to do, not the other way around.\u201d  AD  \u201cWe are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball or any other kind of object,\u201d she added \u2014 reflecting a fear on the European side that Johnson is setting them up to take the blame for a Brexit failure.  The biggest disagreement centers on what to do about the border between Northern Ireland, which is leaving the European Union along with the rest of Britain, and the Republic of Ireland, which is staying.  Since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence, people and goods have been able to pass from one side of the border to the other without any checks. The European Union has maintained that keeping the border open and invisible is critical to ensuring that violence does not flare again.  AD  But Johnson\u2019s proposal would lead to some form of customs controls, setting off nervousness on the island of Ireland.  AD  \u201cOur objective is very clear \u2014 we don\u2019t want to see any customs posts between north and south, nor do we want to see any tariffs or restrictions on trade between north and south,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a Thursday news conference. \u201cThey were all abolished in the 1990s, and we don\u2019t want to go back to that.\u201d  He said he appreciated Johnson\u2019s assurances that there would be no new customs infrastructure. But Varadkar said those assurances seemed to be contradicted by Johnson\u2019s written proposal.  Also making the Europeans anxious: Johnson\u2019s plan would require the European Union to maintain a loosely controlled border with a neighbor that already has said it wants to go its own way on taxation and regulation. E.U. businesses fear such a step could cost them by opening the door to smuggling.  AD  AD  \u201cBrexit is not a game or a bargaining process. We are not ready to do everything in order to have a deal,\u201d French European Affairs Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin told the CNews broadcaster. \u201cThe United Kingdom cannot become a fiscal paradise nor an exporter of goods that do not respect the health and safety rules established by the European Union.\u201d  If there is any chance for a deal at a summit of E.U. leaders that begins Oct. 17, serious negotiations would have to begin immediately, policymakers say. But those talks don\u2019t appear imminent.  The prospects for approval of Johnson\u2019s plan by the British Parliament are also uncertain. Johnson seems to have won the backing of some hard-line Brexiteers who voted against previous Brexit proposals. But he has been hostile toward opposition lawmakers whose support he also needs.

With an election for Parliament less than three weeks away, Quebec\u2019s Bill 21 has become an increasingly uncomfortable topic for the candidates for prime minister.  The legislation, the first of its kind in North America, has drawn criticism across Canada and among rights advocates worldwide. But it has support in Quebec, a key battleground in the tight race between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and opposition leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives. The French-speaking province holds 78 of the 338 seats up for grabs in the Oct. 21 vote.  Which is why the leaders have been somewhat muted in their criticism.  Trudeau, who opposed the bill before it was approved in June, has said he doesn\u2019t believe free societies should be \u201callowing discrimination against anyone.\u201d Scheer said in Montreal this week that he wouldn\u2019t implement such a law at the federal level.

Women protest Bill 21 in Montreal in June. (Christinne Muschi/Reuters)  Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has described Bill 21 as another step in the lengthy process of secularizing the province in which the Catholic Church long wielded outsize influence. Police officers, teachers and other public employees hold positions of authority in their communities, he says, and shouldn\u2019t be wearing symbols that might promote their faith while they serve the public.  Critics see the legislation as an assault on the practices of Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities, many of them relative newcomers to the province. Politicians and activists across Canada and beyond have condemned it; local leaders in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have passed resolutions opposing it.  [In Canada\u2019s election, running against Trump is good politics]  But polls have shown nearly 2 in 3 Quebecers support the law \u2014 making it a \u201chot potato,\u201d pollster Christian Bourque said.  \u201cA leader of a federal government would be going against somewhat of a consensus in the province,\u201d said Bourque, of the Leger polling firm in Montreal. \u201cThey can quickly do away with the issue by saying they won\u2019t personally challenge it.\u201d  Complicating the politics is the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party, which supports the law and is competitive in several districts in the province.

(Ondrej Deml/CTK via AP) (Associated Press)  PRAGUE \u2014 Travis Konecny had two goals and coach Alain Vigneault won his debut with Philadelphia, directing the Flyers to a season-opening 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday.  Oskar Lindblom and Michael Raffl also scored for the Flyers in front of a sellout crowd of 17,463 at Prague\u2019s O2 Arena as part of the NHL\u2019s Global Series. Carter Hart stopped 28 shots.  It was the first regular-season game outside of North America in Philadelphia\u2019s 52-year history.  Patrick Kane had a goal and two assists for Chicago, which opened the 2009-10 season in Finland. Alex Nylander and Alex DeBrincat also scored.  The Blackhawks are hoping to return to the playoffs after a two-year absence, but defensemen Dennis Gilbert and Slater Koekkoek each made a costly mistake after the blue liners struggled last year.  Konecny turned Gilbert\u2019s turnover into a 1-0 lead for Philadelphia 6:24 into the first, beating Corey Crawford on the glove side.  Lindblom was credited with a power-play goal 6:28 into the second when his shot bounced off the crossbar and was deflected by Koekkoek into its own net. Konecny then converted a backhander with 1:56 left in the period, giving the Flyers a 3-1 lead.  Chicago played without defensemen Calvin de Haan and Connor Murphy due to injuries.  Vigneault became the 21st coach in Flyers history in April. He also has coached Montreal, Vancouver and the New York Rangers.  He was behind the bench as Philadelphia held off Chicago in the 26th NHL regular-season game played in Europe, and the fifth in Prague.  The Blackhawks pulled within one when DeBrincat one-timed a pass from Kane past Hart with 13 seconds left in the second. It was DeBrincat\u2019s first goal since he signed a three-year contract extension worth $19.2 million.  Raffl responded for Philadelphia in the third, skating around the net and sliding a backhand between Crawford\u2019s pads for a 4-2 lead at 9:48.  Kane scored with 2:07 remaining, but the Flyers held on.  Crawford finished with 34 saves. Nylander scored in the first period in his first game since he was acquired in an offseason trade with Buffalo.  The NHL returned to Europe for the third straight year as part of its efforts to grow the fan base in hockey-mad countries like the Czech Republic, Sweden, Finland and others.  It will be back in Europe next month when the Tampa Bay Lightning face the Sabres in the Swedish capital of Stockholm.

After a two-day respite from the recent protests that have wracked Haiti\u2019s capital, opposition leaders urged citizens angry over corruption, gas shortages, and inflation to join them for a massive protest march to the local headquarters of the United Nations. (Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press)  PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u2014 Thousands of protesters marched for miles through the Haitian capital to the U.N. headquarters Friday in the one of the largest demonstrations in a weekslong push to demand the ouster of embattled President Jovenel Mo\u00efse.  At least two people were shot as police in riot gear blocked the main entrance to the airport and fired tear gas at the crowd, which responded by throwing rocks and bottles.  Carlos Dorestant, a 22-year-old motorcycle driver, said he saw the man next to him shot, apparently by police, as protesters dismantled a barrier near the U.N. office.  \u201cWe are asking everyone in charge to tell Jovenel to resign,\u201d he said, his shirt stained with blood. \u201cThe people are suffering.\u201d  The unrest on Friday came after almost four weeks of protests in which 17 people have been reported killed, the economy has been largely paralyzed, 2 million children have been kept from going to school and badly needed aid has been suspended, especially to rural areas. The U.S., United Nations and other important international players have yet to drop their support for Mo\u00efse, making it appear unlikely that he will step down, despite protests that have made gasoline, food and water scarce in some areas.  \u201cWe will continue until Jovenel leaves office,\u201d said Sen. Sorel Jacinthe, who was once the president\u2019s ally but joined the opposition earlier this year.  The opposition has rejected Mo\u00efse\u2019s call for dialogue and created a nine-person commission it says would oversee an orderly transition of power, with many demanding a more in-depth investigation into corruption allegations which involve the use of funds from a Venezuela-subsidized oil program. Critics say Mo\u00efse has not looked into the former top government officials accused, including ally and former President Michel Martelly.  To protest against the alleged corruption and a shortage of basic goods, Haitians have taken to the streets in force.  Opposition leader and attorney Andr\u00e9 Michel said the international community should recognize the protesters\u2019 demands and blamed Mo\u00efse for the country\u2019s economic and social problems.  \u201cHe has plunged the country into chaos,\u201d he said.  Mo\u00efse\u2019s ally, former Prime Minister Evans Paul, also met earlier this week with the Core Group, which includes officials from the United Nations, U.S., Canada and France to talk about the political situation. He has said that he believes Mo\u00efse has two options: nominate an opposition-backed prime minister or shorten the length of his mandate.  Mo\u00efse, who owned a company named in the investigation, has denied all corruption allegations. He urges dialogue and says he will not resign.  Laurent Dubois, a Haiti expert and Duke University professor, said there is no clear answer on what might happen next as the turmoil continues.  \u201cThe thing that haunts all of this is ... is this going to lead to the emergence of more authoritarian rule?\u201d he said.  Earlier Friday, police fired tear gas at thousands gathered under a bridge to urge the international community to withdraw support for the president. Some demonstrators were carrying guns, machetes or knives.  A police commander could be heard ordering officers to take up their positions.  \u201cIt\u2019s become more than a protest!\u201d he yelled. At various locations, water cannon trucks were on hand.  Getta Julien, 47, said she had enough of the protests and the president as she stabilized portions of rice, beans and vegetables she had packed into foam containers.  \u201cHe has to go,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing nothing for the country. Nothing at all.\u201d  Nearby, others cheered as Jacinthe arrived and greeted supporters, including an artist riding a white horse amid burning tires as he carried a large red and black flag that read, \u201cLong live the economic revolution.\u201d  One protester, 38-year-old electrician Delva Sonel, said he did not want the international community to interfere.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to send a signal to the world that we\u2019re not a little country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to tell them to stay out of our business.\u201d  Some questioned why international leaders had not spoken publicly against Mo\u00efse even as he and his administration face corruption allegations.  \u201cHow can they support this government if it represents everything that is wrong?\u201d said Israel Voltaire, a 35-year-old attorney. \u201cWith us being a democratic country, it\u2019s like we\u2019re losing the war.\u201d  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament that Turkey plans to settle 2 million refugees in the zone and will hold a donors\u2019 conference to help build homes and infrastructure for them.

Mustafa Sejari, a National Army commander, said there are now about 100,000 fighters operating in the Turkey-backed national army.  The unification could also set the stage for a possible confrontation with Idlib\u2019s dominant Jihadi groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, HTS or Huras al-Din.  \u201cWe face many tasks internally, regarding HTS or externally to ward off Syrian government forces if they try to enter Idlib or violate the cease-fire,\u201d Sejari said.  Idlib is the last area held by opposition fighters, without foreign power presence. Syrian government troops have been carrying out a military offensive there, but a cease-fire has brought a lull to the fighting.  It was not clear how the new opposition forces restructuring would affect government plans.  _______  Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser contributed to this report from Ankara, Turkey.

Masked protesters streamed into Hong Kong streets Friday after the city\u2019s embattled leader invoked rarely used emergency powers to ban masks at rallies in a hardening of the government\u2019s stance after four months of anti-government demonstrations. (Vincent Yu/Associated Press)  HONG KONG \u2014 Defiant masked protesters rampaged, police fired tear gas, and a teen was wounded by gunfire hours after Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader banned masks at rallies, invoking rarely used emergency powers to quell four months of anti-government demonstrations.  Challenging the ban, which went into effect Saturday, thousands of protesters crammed streets in the central business district and other areas Friday night, shouting \u201cHong Kong people, resist!\u201d Two activists filed legal challenges on grounds the ban would instill fear and curtail freedom of assembly, but a court denied their request for an injunction.  Pockets of angry protesters attacked Chinese bank outlets and shops, vandalized subway stations and set street fires across the city, prompting police to respond with tear gas in many areas. An officer fired a single shot from his gun in self-defense after he was attacked by protesters in the northern Yuen Long district, said police spokeswoman Yolanda Yu. She said a male was wounded, but that police didn\u2019t know exactly how he got shot.  A police official, who requested anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the news media, said the male is 14. A Hospital Authority spokesman said the teen was in serious but not critical condition.  The teen became the second victim of gunfire since pro-democracy protests began in June and just three days after an 18-year-old protester was shot by a riot police officer at close range.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a news conference Friday that the mask ban, imposed under a colonial-era Emergency Ordinance that was last used over half a century ago, would be \u201can effective deterrent to radical behavior.\u201d  \u201cWe must save Hong Kong \u2014 the present Hong Kong and the future Hong Kong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must stop the violence. ... We can\u2019t just leave the situation to get worse and worse.\u201d  Lam said she would seek the legislature\u2019s backing for the ban later. She insisted the semiautonomous Chinese territory was not in a state of emergency but wouldn\u2019t rule out a further toughening of measures if violence continued. She dismissed suggestions that she should resign, saying it would be unhelpful at a time when Hong Kong is in \u201ca very critical state of public danger.\u201d  Face masks have become a hallmark of protesters in Hong Kong, even at peaceful marches, amid fears of retribution at work or of being denied access to schooling, public housing and other government-funded services. Some young protesters also wear full gas masks and goggles to protect against tear gas. Many are concerned their identities could be shared with the massive state-security apparatus that helps keep the Communist Party in power in mainland China, where high-tech surveillance including facial recognition technology is ubiquitous.  Lam\u2019s ban applies to all public gatherings, both unauthorized and those approved by police. It makes the wearing of any face coverings, including face paint, punishable by one year in jail. A six-month jail term could be imposed on people who refuse a police officer\u2019s order to remove a face covering for identification. Masks will be permitted when wearers can prove they need them for work, health or religious reasons.  Thousands of masked protesters marched before Lam spoke. The rallies spread to many areas as protesters vowed not to be cowed. Many blocked traffic, smashed up shops and public properties, and set fires at streets and subway exits before the protests ended after midnight.  \u201cWill they arrest 100,000 people on the street?\u201d said a protester who gave his surname as Lui. \u201cThe government is trying to intimidate us, but at this moment, I don\u2019t think the people will be scared.\u201d  A protester who identified himself as Ernest Ho noted that Hong Kong police wear masks \u201cand they don\u2019t show their pass and their number.\u201d  \u201cSo, I will still keep my mask on everywhere,\u201d Ho said.  Analysts said the use of the Emergency Ordinance set a dangerous precedent. The law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city\u2019s chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.  \u201cIf the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties,\u201d said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University and no relation to Carrie Lam.  British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Lam\u2019s government should avoid aggravating tensions and that \u201cpolitical dialogue is the only way\u201d out. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the world\u2019s oldest leader, said Lam should resign and predicted Beijing would send in its military to end the crisis.  Carrie Lam bristled at a suggestion that the mask ban nudged Hong Kong closer to authoritarian rule. She insisted she was not acting under orders from Beijing, which she visited this week when Communist Party leaders celebrated 70 years in power on Tuesday. But Yang Guang, a Chinese spokesman for Hong Kong affairs, expressed support late Friday, saying it was time for stern measures to end the conflict.  The ban came after widespread violence Tuesday across Hong Kong that marred China\u2019s National Day, when a police officer shot a protester at close range, escalating the violence since protests started over a now-shelved extradition bill. The wounded teenager was charged with attacking police and rioting.  The government last month withdrew the extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but the movement has snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections of the city\u2019s leader and police accountability.  More than 2,100 people have been detained so far, including 204 charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to a decade in prison.  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Iraqi security forces fired live bullets into the air and used tear gas against a few hundred protesters in central Baghdad on Thursday, hours after a curfew was announced in the Iraqi capital on the heels of two days of deadly violence that gripped the country amid anti-government protests that killed over 19 people in two days. (Hadi Mizban/Associated Press)  BAGHDAD \u2014 The Latest on developments in Iraq, amid deadly violence over anti-government protests (all times local):  10:35 p.m.  An influential Iraqi Shiite cleric has called on the government to resign and early elections be held to bring the country out of a crisis that has left more than 50 dead in four days.  Muqtada al-Sadr issued a statement Friday night saying that shedding the blood of \u201cIraqis cannot be ignored.\u201d  Earlier in the day, al-Sadr\u2019s Sairoon political bloc in parliament that came in first in last year\u2019s national elections said it was suspending participation in parliamentary activities until the government introduces a program that serves Iraqi aspirations.  Since the spontaneous rallies began Tuesday, security forces have fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse them in multiple provinces.  The demonstrators are demanding jobs, improved services like electricity and water, and an end to corruption in the oil-rich country.  __  9:25 p.m.  Iraq\u2019s Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi says he supports the demands of protesters, adding that the legislature will work on fighting corruption that is \u201cas dangerous as terrorism.\u201d  Al-Halbusi said four days of protests \u201care an important lesson\u201d to Iraqi officials calling for an investigation into attacks on protesters.  He promised the state will soon begin building apartments for the poor.  The official called on protesters to stand by the Iraqi state in chasing those \u201cwho robbed the money of the people.\u201d He added that protesters should not attack state institutions since the property is for the people.  Al-Halbusi said Iraqis should fight corruption \u201cthe way we fought terrorism.\u201d He was referring to the fight against the Islamic State group that was officially defeated in Iraq in 2017.  ___  9:10 p.m.  The U.N. envoy for Iraq is welcoming Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s call for unity, dialogue and action.  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Friday that Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said \u201cthere is an opportunity to move forward and that the interests of the country must be prioritized above all else.\u201d  Mostly young demonstrators are demanding jobs, improved services like electricity and water, and an end to corruption in the oil-rich country.  Dujarric quoted Hennis-Plasschaert as saying that \u201cdialogue must pave the way to understanding, reconciliation and progress.\u201d  Meanwhile, the Geneva-based U.N. human rights office called on the Iraqi government Friday to allow people to freely exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, Dujarric said.  The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said the use of force \u201cshould be exceptional,\u201d and comply with international rights standards including \u201cnecessity and proportionality,\u201d according to Dujarric.  ___  7:20 p.m.  Iraqi medical and security officials say 10 more protesters have been killed in the capital Baghdad, raising the death toll in four days of protests to 53.  The officials said nine people were killed Friday afternoon in Baghdad\u2019s central area of Gailani, near Tahrir Square where the protests in the capital have been concentrated.  The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, added that one person was also killed in Baghdad\u2019s southern neighborhood of Zaafaraniya.  The figure raises to 11 the number of people killed in Baghdad Friday.  The protests that began on Tuesday in Baghdad have spread to predominantly Shiite southern provinces.  The spontaneous rallies have been spurred mostly by youths wanting jobs, improved services such as electricity and water, and an end to corruption.  \u2014 By Qassim Abdul-Zahra.  ___  3:45 p.m.  An influential Iraqi Shiite cleric whose political coalition came in first in last year\u2019s national elections says he\u2019s suspending participation in parliament activities until the government introduces a program that serves Iraqi aspirations.  Muqtada al-Sadr has asked members of his parliament bloc to boycott sessions until the government issues a program acceptable to the people.  Al-Sadr\u2019s Sairoon electoral list won the largest single bloc of seats in parliament elections last year. The bloc has 54 seats in the 329-member parliament.  The move comes after Iraq\u2019s top Shiite authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, blamed lawmakers for failing to enact reforms and eradicate corruption.  ___  3:30 p.m.  Three Gulf Arab nations have advised their citizens to avoid traveling to Iraq and those who are there to leave the country immediately.  Friday\u2019s call by Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain comes after three days of protests in Iraq that have left 42 people dead.  The Kuwaiti news agency Kuna cited a Foreign Ministry official as urging Kuwaiti nationals to avoid traveling to Iraq due to the demonstrations, and for those already there to leave as soon as possible, and to avoid areas where protests are held.  Qatar\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a similar request.  Bahrain\u2019s Foreign Ministry also called on its country\u2019s citizens not to travel to Iraq and urged those already in Iraq to \u201cleave immediately.\u201d  ___  3:15 p.m.  Iraqi security forces have again opened fire on protesters gathered in central Baghdad, wounding one person on the fourth day of violence amid anti-government rallies.  The protesters were gathered in a street behind Tayaran Square on Friday, chanting slogans when security forces opened fire. A young man was shot in the leg.  It was the first shooting after Iraq\u2019s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, earlier in the day called on both sides to cease violence, which has gripped Iraq since Tuesday.  Many across Iraq\u2019s predominantly Shiite south had looked to the influential cleric for guidance.  ___  1:15 p.m.  Iraq\u2019s most influential Shiite cleric has called for an end to the violence gripping the country, urging both sides to pull back \u201cbefore it is too late.\u201d  The comments by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani were his first since anti-government protests began earlier this week. The violence has killed 42 people so far.  He also criticized the government, as well as the leaders of the two biggest parliament blocs, saying they failed to fulfill their promises to the people.  Al-Sistani called on political leaders to take \u201cpractical and clear steps\u201d toward combatting corruption and on the government to \u201ccarry out its duty\u201d to diminish people\u2019s suffering.  He reiterated his suggestion for a committee of technocrats tasked with making recommendations on fighting corruption, as a way out of the current crisis.  Al-Sistani\u2019s message was delivered on Friday by his representative Ahmed al-Safi in the Shiite holy city of Karbala.  ___  12:30 p.m.  Iraqi officials are reporting nine more deaths in anti-government protests in a southern city, bringing this week\u2019s overall death toll to 42.  Hospital officials say the deaths occurred late Thursday in Nasiriyah, which has witnessed the most violence in the protests, with at least 25 people, including a policeman, killed. The city is about 320 kilometers, or 200 miles, southeast of Baghdad.  The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.  Since Tuesday, security forces have fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse protesters demanding job opportunities, improved services and an end to corruption.  Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi who hails from Nasiriyah, has urged calm, saying he\u2019s working to meet protesters legitimate demands but adding that there\u2019s no magic solution for Iraq\u2019s problems.  \u2014Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad;  ___  8:35 a.m.  Iraq\u2019s prime minister has addressed the nation over the turmoil gripping the country, calling on protesters to go home and saying their demands have been heard.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi says that the security measures imposed in the wake of this week\u2019s violence, including the temporary curfew, are \u201cdifficult choices\u201d but are needed like \u201cbitter medicine\u201d that has to be swallowed.  Iraqi security forces have imposed a round-the-clock curfew in Baghdad. Since Tuesday, they fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse anti-government protests, leaving 33 people dead and wounding hundreds.  The prime minister\u2019s speech was televised early on Friday.  He told protesters their \u201clegitimate\u201d demands in countering corruption and providing jobs have been heard and that it\u2019s \u201cimportant to help the government perform its duty toward you.\u201d  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Documents have been filed on behalf of Prince Harry over the alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.  His wife Meghan this week began legal action against the Mail on Sunday.  It is accused of unlawfully publishing a private letter to her father.  A spokeswoman for News Group Newspapers (NGN) - the publishers of the Sun and the News of The World - said: \"We confirm that a claim has been issued by the Duke of Sussex.\"  The details of the duke's new legal action were first reported by the website Byline.  The BBC understands the duke's allegations against NGN predate 2010, but it is not yet clear when his claims against the Mirror date from.  A source at Reach, which owns the Mirror, told the Press Association it was aware proceedings had been issued but had not yet received them, so was unable to comment further.  Jonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, says the presumption is the legal action goes back to the phone-hacking scandal of the early 2000s.  What is the phone-hacking scandal?  Allegations of phone-hacking at the News of the World led to the closure of the tabloid in 2011 and an eight-month trial.  The story dates back to around 2007, when Clive Goodman, the then News of the World royal editor, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator were convicted of intercepting voicemail messages left for royal aides and subsequently jailed.  The technique saw journalists hack into voicemail messages of celebrities by using a default factory-set PIN number and subsequently use the information to write news stories.  Princes William and Harry and the then Kate Middleton were all named among the victims in the 2011 trial, which led to a public inquiry.  One journalist pleaded guilty to phone-hacking at both the News of the World and the Sunday Mirror, while a judge in a civil trial against the Mirror ruled that phone-hacking at the paper was \"widespread\".  Between them, the two newspaper groups have paid out almost \u00a3500m to victims of phone-hacking in settlements and legal costs.  The duke's fresh legal claim comes just days after he accused the British tabloid press of \"relentless propaganda\" in his statement announcing his wife's legal action.  In the statement, which was issued during the couple's tour of southern Africa, Prince Harry said the \"painful\" impact of intrusive media coverage had forced them to take action.  Image copyright AFP Image caption The Duchess of Sussex recently launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday  Referring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, the prince said his \"deepest fear is history repeating itself\".  \"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,\" he said.  'Years of abuse'  Brian Cathcart, co-founder of Hacked Off, a campaign group which represents phone-hacking victims, told BBC News the move was a \"measure of how far the couple have been pushed\".  \"For years and years the royals have been a free shot for the press,\" he said.  \"This man has suffered very badly because of that - we know what happened to his mother.\"  He added: \"I think we've moved on from the idea that celebrities are not entitled to privacy.  \"The duke and duchess need to draw a line, they've had years of abuse.\"  The two newspaper groups could face a total bill for phone-hacking of up to \u00a31bn, Hacked Off said earlier this year.  Dozens of celebrities have settled claims with the Mirror group, including actor Hugh Grant, while Sir Elton John, Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Mills settled claims against News Group Newspapers earlier this year.  Paul Connew, former deputy editor at the News of the World and the Sunday Mirror, told the BBC the duke was \"determined to attack the popular press\" in suing over \"allegations which date back about 15 years.\"  Mr Connew suggested that the duke had launched the claim following \"the rather over the top statement earlier this week attacking the press as a whole\".  He added: \"Prince William has a more mature take of the press and I expect that in the long run Prince Harry could come to regret this.\"  Media lawyer Mark Stephens said royals \"rarely\" take legal action because it can be a \"high-risk strategy\".  He told the BBC that the processes of legal disclosure of information between lawyers and then the royals being cross-examined could take them to \"places they don't really want\".  \"So it is a high-risk strategy because things are outside their control.  \"But it's also a high-risk strategy for the editors who are going to have to give evidence, too.\"", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T21:32:41", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49933843", "title": "Carl Beech: Police searches over VIP abuse claims 'unlawful'", "text": "Image copyright Gloucestershire Police Image caption Carl Beech was jailed for 18 years after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice, fraud and child sexual offences  A review of Scotland Yard's disastrous inquiry into false allegations of a VIP paedophile ring found warrants to search the homes of the wrongly accused suspects were obtained \"unlawfully\".  Retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said searches of the homes of three prominent people \"should not have taken place\".  He has reviewed the Met's investigation into allegations made by Carl Beech.  Beech, 51, from Gloucester, was jailed for 18 years for his false accusations.  Beech, previously known as \"Nick\" in the media, made false allegations of murder and child sexual abuse against prominent public figures.  The Metropolitan Police spent \u00a32.5m investigating his claims after publicly saying they were \"credible and true\".  The Met has published the first three chapters of the 2016 Henriques report after being criticised for previously releasing a heavily redacted version.  A report by the Independent Office of Police Conduct - expected to be published next week - previously examined the role of three detectives in applying for search warrants, but did not look into Operation Midland as a whole.  When - following Beech's convictions in July - the IOPC announced it had cleared the officers, Sir Richard criticised that outcome, saying a criminal investigation should take place.  Image copyright PA Media/Getty Images Image caption The searches of the homes of Lord Bramall, Harvey Proctor and Lord Brittan were deemed unlawful  Among the establishment figures Beech wrongly accused of sexual abuse were former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath, former Labour MP Lord Janner and ex-MI6 boss Sir Maurice Oldfield.  The homes of several men were raided by police, including those owned by Normandy veteran Field Marshall Lord Bramall, former Home Secretary Lord Brittan - who died while under investigation - and former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, which Sir Richard said were \"unlawful\".  In the now published 2016 report, the retired judge said police \"misled\" the magistrate who authorised the search by claiming Beech's claims were \"consistent and credible\".  Sir Richard said Beech's account \"had not been consistent\" and there were \"no reasonable grounds\" to believe him.  Mr Proctor told the BBC the police search had been \"intimidating\" and \"completely out of the blue\".  Sir Stephen House, deputy commissioner of the Met, said the officers who applied for the search warrants had acted with \"due diligence and in good faith\" and an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) review found there were \"no grounds for misconduct\".  Sir Richard is also highly critical of the Met's decision to hold a press briefing on 18 December 2014 - soon after the investigation began - in which detectives said they believed \"Nick\" and considered his claims to be \"credible and true\" - a phrase that was repeated several times that day by Det Supt Kenny McDonald.  In a finding, the retired judge wrote: \"Since the credibility of 'Nick' was not established, a decision to inform the public via the media that 'we believe 'Nick' was a serious mistake.\"  Sir Richard's report makes clear that Det Supt McDonald's line manager - Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse - knew he would use such language.  The judge wrote that if Mr Rodhouse \"did believe 'Nick' his judgement was at fault. If he did not believe 'Nick', he had decided to mislead the public.\"  Mr Rodhouse said he was \"sincerely sorry for the distress caused\".  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Carl Beech triggered the Met's Operation Midland with his allegations  Mr Proctor heavily criticised the police for saying they believed Beech's accusations to be \"true\".  He said: \"The effect of that was that for nine months before they withdrew the word 'true', the Met Police were putting on the record that I was a serial murderer of children.  \"That is outrageous and has been very difficult to live with. I'm not the same person I used to be, I don't think I will ever be that person again.\"  He said he had received death threats and lost his job, his home and his reputation.  Sir Richard was also critical of how Mr Rodhouse handled a separate Met inquiry into a rape claim against Lord Brittan by a female complainant stating that his actions prolonged the inquiry.  The former Home Secretary died without being informed that he had been cleared.  Sir Richard commended a decision by the original investigating officer - Det Con Insp Paul Settle - to end the investigation without interviewing Lord Brittan, which was reversed after he was removed from the case.

He said he was conscious of the \"dreadful impact on wrongly accused individuals and their families\".  Sir Stephen said: \"There was a significant amount of pressure on a lot of different public bodies in relation to not taking seriously allegations around this type of assault.  \"That does not excuse the mistakes made but it explains some of the thinking we had.\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Labour deputy leader Tom Watson met \"Nick\" and \"created further pressure upon police\", said the report  The report also said \"there can be no doubt\" Labour MP Tom Watson \"believed Nick\" and \"created further pressure upon officers\".  Mr Watson - who is now the party's deputy leader - said the review \"contains multiple inaccuracies\" about him and police asked him to \"encourage the hundreds of people that came to me with stories of child abuse to report their stories to the police\".  Sir Richard also criticised the effect BBC journalists had upon the investigation.  He records how BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds showed Beech pictures of two boys who were either murdered or went missing in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he met him in November 2014.  Police subsequently investigated whether one of the boys - Martin Allen, who went missing in London - was one of the three boys allegedly murdered by the people Beech accused.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered a third review of the Met's investigation  Sir Richard records that relatives of Martin Allen were subsequently spoken to by detectives and that the \"upset caused to that family is one of several distressing aspects of this case\".  The retired judge wrote that the \"photographic identification by Symonds was fundamentally flawed and would not be admitted in a court\".  He said senior officers should have told the BBC's reporters and a retired social worker who was also working with Beech \"not to feed information to 'Nick'\".  Compensation fraud  Sir Richard also criticised the now-defunct news website Exaro News, which also met with Beech and showed him 42 pictures of men, through which Beech identified Mr Proctor and Lord Bramall.  He said: \"There can be no doubt that 'Nick' received information and assistance from Exaro and other journalists that misled officers and contributed to their concluding at an early stage that 'Nick' was credible.\"  The report also criticised officers who helped Beech claim \u00a322,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, for which he was later convicted of fraud.  Sir Richard said: \"Assisting a claimant to recover compensation before an investigation is complete prejudges the outcome of the investigation and should not have happened.  \"Having assisted 'Nick' to claim compensation rendered it more difficult to discontinue this investigation,\" he said.  Number 10 said the case was \"deeply concerning\" which is why Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered an inspection by the chief inspector of constabulary, following Sir Richard's review.", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T18:46:56", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49936352", "title": "Brexit: Boris Johnson will send extension letter", "text": "Image copyright PA Media Image caption The PM said last month he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than ask for a Brexit delay  Boris Johnson will send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no deal is agreed by 19 October, according to government papers submitted to a Scottish court.  The document was revealed as campaigners sought a ruling forcing the PM to comply with the law.  Their QC said it contradicted statements by Mr Johnson in Parliament.  But the prime minister said the UK would still be leaving on 31 October, deal or no deal, \"but no delay\".  Talks between the two sides aimed at resolving differences over the Irish border will resume on Monday, with the UK urging the EU \"to work with us at pace to agree a new deal\".  The so-called Benn Act - named after Labour MP Hilary Benn who spearheaded its passage into law - requires the government to request an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal has not been signed off by Parliament by 19 October.  A senior Downing Street source said: \"The government will comply with the Benn Act, which only imposes a very specific narrow duty concerning Parliament's letter requesting a delay - drafted by an unknown subset of MPs and pro-EU campaigners - and which can be interpreted in different ways.  \"But the government is not prevented by the Act from doing other things that cause no delay, including other communications, private and public.  \"People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled. The government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\"  Any extension to the Article 50 process - the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU - would have to be agreed by all 27 other EU leaders.  Mr Johnson has said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than ask for a delay. In a tweet on Friday afternoon, he said: \"New deal or no deal - but no delay.\"  The European Commission said its position that the UK's proposed new deal did \"not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\" had not changed after a day of talks with UK officials, but discussions would continue on Monday.  Analysis  By BBC Political Correspondent Jessica Parker  So there it is. In black and white. An undertaking that the prime minister accepts something that he has never publicly accepted before.  That if Parliament hasn't approved a deal - or given the nod to no-deal - by 19 October, he will have to send a letter asking for an extension.  Ministers have previously said that they will abide by the Benn Act but also \"test\" it, leading to speculation that they were hunting for a loophole.  But don't imagine that today's news means Number 10 has given up on sticking to its 31 October deadline, deal or no deal.  In fact, some will suspect that the document submitted to the Court of Session is simply a way of discouraging the court from issuing an order that could have handed the power, of writing that letter, to someone else; a court clerk or the Cabinet Secretary.  And Downing Street is hardly trying to stymie the suspicion that they have something else up their sleeve.  The question is what?  It's a question everyone in Westminster is asking.  The Scottish legal action has been initiated by businessman Dale Vince, QC Jo Maugham and SNP MP Joanna Cherry.  They want the Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, to rule on the extent to which Mr Johnson is bound by the Benn Act.

So we want to make the court to make orders obliging him to do it, and if he doesn't then do it then he will face personal criminal consequences.\"  Steve Baker, chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Conservative MPs, said the government document changed nothing.  \"All this means is that government will obey the law. It does not mean we will extend. It does not mean we will stay in the EU beyond 31 October. We will leave.\"  Image copyright PA Media Image caption SNP MP Joanna Cherry speaks to reporters outside the Court of Session  But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: \"Boris said we would leave by October 31st 'do or die'.  \"Why does he keep saying things that are not true?\"  And anti-Brexit former Tory MP Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, said: \"I just think this is further evidence that you can't trust a single word that this prime minister says.\"  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he did not want to \"comment on court cases that are happening in the UK. They'll play themselves out\".  He told a press conference in Denmark the EU would consider a request for a further Brexit extension if Mr Johnson asked for one, adding: \"Certainly an extension would be better than a no deal\".  However, he said many other EU countries would need a \"good reason\" to approve a further delay to the UK's exit.  He said his preference was to reach a deal with the UK by the summit of European leaders on 17 October and said he believed this was still possible.  \"Our focus is getting a deal at the EU Council and I believe that's possible,\" he added.", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T20:09:40", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49939173", "title": "Hong Kong: Face mask ban prompts thousands to protest", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tear gas fired as protests continue after face mask ban in Hong Kong  Thousands have taken part in unplanned protests in Hong Kong after the territory's government announced a face mask ban, which came into effect at midnight (16:00 GMT).  Chief executive Carrie Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law in a bid to quell months of anti-government unrest.  The ban comes after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October, when an officer shot a demonstrator.  Reports on Friday said a 14-year-old had been shot in the leg.  He is reportedly being treated at Tuen Mun hospital and is in a serious condition.  A police statement published by the South China Morning Post confirmed an officer \"fired one shot as his life was under serious threat\" after being attacked by a large group of protesters, including with petrol bombs. The statement does not however say if anyone was hit.  The demonstrations have now died down throughout most of the territory, although there are still pockets of unrest.  What happened on Friday?  Protests erupted immediately after the ban was announced.  Many left work early to join the spontaneous demonstrations. Some furious protesters blocked roads, torched Chinese flags and vandalised stations and businesses, as police fired rounds of tear gas.  The territory's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) announced a full service suspension of all trains, which will continue on Saturday morning until an assessment can be carried out.  A spokesman told the BBC this was due to vandalism and attacks on staff. Images showed fires lit at stations, and reports suggest a train was set ablaze.  Many Hong Kongers were forced to walk home amid the unrest.

Ms Lam said she was forced to implement the colonial-era law because violence at the now-weekly protests was \"destroying the city\", and she could not allow the situation \"to get worse and worse\".  The end of anonymity  Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong  Angry protesters chanted as they marched through the heart of this financial hub. They ripped down a banner marking 70 years of communist rule, setting it alight in front of a cheering crowd.  Hundreds wore masks in defiance of the ban.

Anonymity has become a key part of this movement but many fear that the introduction of this emergency law could lead to further restrictions.  This protest movement began in opposition to an extradition bill now withdrawn from the legislature. The use of the emergency law did not need to go through the legislative body.  Carrie Lam insists that the territory is not in a state of emergency, but the law allows her to take further emergency measures.  What's been the reaction to the ban?  Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of \"draconian\" measures.  \"This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP. \"And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner.\"  The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a news conference in Geneva that \"any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible\".  UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said \"political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation\".  Where does the ban apply?  The ban will apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots.  The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas.  Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Some demonstrators blocked roads and set fires while police fired tear gas  There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession.  Ms Lam said \"violence had been escalating to alarming levels\" leading to a situation of \"chaos and panic\" in the city.  What is the Emergency Regulations Ordinance?  The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years.  It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council.

Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was \"in a state of serious public danger\".  What is the background?  Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China.  The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations.

The Beatles' Abbey Road has returned to number one in the UK, 50 years after it first topped the album charts.  The Fab Four reclaimed the top spot with an expanded anniversary edition.  The feat also sees the album set a record - the gap of 49 years and 252 days since its initial chart-topping run ended in early 1970 is the longest gap before returning to number one.  \"It's hard to believe that Abbey Road still holds up after all these years,\" tweeted Sir Paul McCartney on Friday.  \"But then again it's a bloody cool album,\" he added.  The new version features original tracks such as Here Comes The Sun and Come Together as well as previously unheard material from the recording sessions.  The previous record for longest gap between number one appearances by the same album was held by (yup, you guessed it) The Beatles again, for their seminal 1967 record, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The sprawling psych-rock masterpiece returned to number one in 2017 courtesy of another anniversary re-release - a mere 49 years and 125 days after its previous spell at the top.  Abbey Road was also this week's best-selling album on vinyl, shifting just under 9,000 copies.  It knocked the new album by self-confessed Beatles superfan Liam Gallagher off the number one slot. The former Oasis rock 'n' roll star's second solo effort, Why Me? Why Not, debuted at the top of the chart last week.  Monumental medley  Despite being their penultimate release, Abbey Road was in fact the last album The Beatles ever recorded together. Let It Be, which came out the following year, had been recorded first, but was initially shelved over disagreements about its production.  The first side of Abbey Road contains well known songs like Something and Octopus's Garden. But it's the eight track medley on side two, from the McCartney piano ballad, You Never Give Me Your Money, to The End - which contains one of Ringo Starr's rare recorded drum solos - which for many marks the LP out as their crowning glory.  The Liverpool band revealed they created the sequence to \"use up\" a host of incomplete songs and while it was McCartney's idea, producer George Martin - aka the fifth Beatle - takes the credit for the kaleidoscopic structure.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Beatles fans flooded Abbey Road to mark the anniversary  Last week, thousands of fans made the pilgrimage to west London recording studio from which the album takes it name, to mark its half-century.  Many of them recreated the classic cover artwork, which depicted The Beatles bass player walking barefoot over a zebra crossing, alongside bandmates Starr, George Harrison and John Lennon.  Jaime Garri, 61, flew more than 14 hours from Santiago, Chile, to mark the occasion.  \"You have to say thank you to them for giving us such lovely music,\" he said.  The Arctic Monkeys paid their own tribute to the record back in 2012 when they performed its Chuck Berry-inspired opening track, with the eyes of the world upon them, at director Danny Boyle's opening ceremony to the London Olympics.

Edward Putman, 54, claimed he had found the winning ticket under a seat in his van in 2009 just before the deadline to claim the win passed.  But St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs who knew how to cheat the system.  Putman, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of fraud by false representation.  The court heard the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, who had a row with Putman over how the winnings were divided, took his own life in October 2015.  Sentencing Putman, Judge Philip Grey called it a \"sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud\".  \"You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy\", he added.  \"This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself.\"  Image copyright South Beds News Agency Image caption The fake ticket was used by Putman to claim the Lottery win  Putman claimed the win on 28 August 2009 by using a badly-damaged ticket forged by Mr Knibbs, who worked for Camelot in the fraud detection department.  Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed and prosecutor James Keeley said there was \"some trial and error\" in producing the successful forgery.  The court heard each ticket had one of the 100 different possible unique codes at the bottom and Putman had gone to 29 different shops, providing a different ticket in each, before the right number was found at a shop in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.  Mr Knibbs confessed to friends he had \"conned\" the Lottery after the row with Putman, a convicted rapist and benefits cheat, in June 2015.  He also told them about technical inaccuracies in the creation of the ticket that Putman, of Station Road, had used.  Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was initially paid \u00a3280,000 by Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by much smaller increments totalling \u00a350,000.

Three years later he was sentenced to nine months in jail for benefit fraud after claiming \u00a313,000 in housing and income support following his win.  In 2016, the Gambling Commission fined Camelot \u00a33m for breaching its operating licence regarding controlling databases, investigating prize claims, and paying out prizes.  A Camelot spokeswoman said there were \"some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we're very sorry for that\".  \"We've strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,\" she added.

The figure has nearly doubled in the past 24 hours, as clashes between protesters and police intensified.  The military said \"unidentified snipers\" had killed four people in Baghdad, including two police officers.  Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi earlier said protesters' \"legitimate demands\" had been heard, but appealed for calm.  Spontaneous protests erupted on Tuesday amid frustration over Iraq's high youth unemployment rate, its dire public services and chronic corruption.  It is seen as the first major challenge to Mr Mahdi's fragile government, nearly a year since he came to power.  What's the latest?  Despite the prime minister's plea for patience, Iraqis continued to throng the streets in their hundreds on Friday. An indefinite curfew imposed by authorities in the capital, as well as an internet blackout, also failed to prevent protesters from gathering.

Reuters says the total death toll has risen to 65, however, AFP gives the lower figure of 44, including six members of Iraqi security forces. Hundreds more have been wounded.  Much of the violence has been concentrated in Baghdad and majority Shia Muslim areas in the south, including Amara, Diwaniya and Hilla. A number of deaths were reported on Friday in the southern city of Nasiriya, about 320km (200 miles) away.  What's been the reaction?  In his first speech since unrest began, Prime Minister Mahdi vowed early on Friday to respond to protesters' concerns but warned there was no \"magic solution\" to Iraq's problems.  He said he had given his full backing to security forces, insisting they were abiding by \"international standards\" in dealing with protesters.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Reuters reporters on the ground witnessed protesters being shot by live fire on Friday  Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged the government to respond to the demands for reform, saying it has \"not answered the demands of the people to fight corruption or achieved anything on the ground\".  Meanwhile, Moqtada Sadr - another highly influential Shia cleric who leads the largest opposition bloc in parliament - demanded the Iraqi government resign and call snap elections.  Mr Sadr also instructed his lawmakers to pull out of parliament, until the government devises a programme acceptable to the wider public.

Peter O'Brien, 51, from Llanishen, Cardiff and Mark Sim, 41, of Caldicot, Monmouthshire, both died in November 2015 following the incident.  The company apologised \"for the shortcomings which contributed to the most tragic event in our history\".

The 4m (13ft) wide artwork Devolved Parliament was painted by the anonymous Bristol artist in 2009.  Expected to fetch up to \u00a32m, it sold for nearly five times its estimate at Sotheby's in London on Thursday.

The pictures were taken more than 150 years ago during an expedition to Brazil's Upper Amazon and are believed to be the earliest photographic record of the area. Frisch's pictures capture both the natural landscape and its indigenous inhabitants of among others the Ticuan, Miranha and Caixana tribes.  The collection comprises 98 albumen prints which were first published in 1869 by publisher Georg Leuzinger.

It was he who commissioned Frisch to produce photographs of the undisturbed Amazon.

He produced more than 120 glass plate negatives using the wet collodion process which required him to travel with a portable laboratory.  The process meant that the photographic plates had to be prepared moments before they were exposed in the camera with development taking place immediately while they were still wet.

Thibault, 30, said taking his first steps in the suit felt like being the \"first man on the Moon\".  His movements, particularly walking, are far from perfect and the robo-suit is being used only in the lab.  But researchers say the approach could one day improve patients' quality of life.  How does it work?  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  Thibault had surgery to place two implants on the surface of the brain, covering the parts of the brain that control movement  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  Sixty-four electrodes on each implant read the brain activity and beam the instructions to a nearby computer  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  Sophisticated computer software reads the brainwaves and turns them into instructions for controlling the exoskeleton  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  Thibault has to be strapped into the exoskeleton  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  When he thinks \"walk\" it sets off a chain of movements in the robotic suit that move his legs forward  Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec  And he can control each of the arms, manoeuvring them in three-dimensional space  How easy was it to use?  Thibault, who does not want his surname revealed, was an optician before he fell 15m in an incident at a night club four years ago.  The injury to his spinal cord left him paralysed and he spent the next two years in hospital.  But in 2017, he took part in the exoskeleton trial with Clinatec and the University of Grenoble.  Initially he practised using the brain implants to control a virtual character, or avatar, in a computer game, then he moved on to walking in the suit.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mind-controlled exoskeleton allows paralysed 30-year-old man to walk in French lab  \"It was like [being the] first man on the Moon. I didn't walk for two years. I forgot what it is to stand, I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room,\" he said.  It took a lot longer to learn how to control the arms.  \"It was very difficult because it is a combination of multiple muscles and movements. This is the most impressive thing I do with the exoskeleton.\"  How good is the exoskeleton?  The 65kg of sophisticated robotics is not completely restoring function.  However, it is a marked advance on similar approaches that allow people to control a single limb with their thoughts.  Thibault does need to be attached to a ceiling-harness in order to minimise the risk of him falling over in the exoskeleton - it means the device is not yet ready to move outside the laboratory.  \"This is far from autonomous walking,\" Prof Alim-Louis Benabid, the president of the Clinatec executive board, told BBC News.  \"He does not have the quick and precise movements not to fall, nobody on earth does this.\"  In tasks where Thibault had to touch specific targets by using the exoskeleton to move his upper and lower arms and rotate his wrists, he was successful 71% of the time.  Prof Benabid, who developed deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, told the BBC: \"We have solved the problem and shown the principle is correct. This is proof we can extend the mobility of patients in an exoskeleton.  \"This is in [the] direction of giving better quality of life.\"  What is the next step?  The French scientists say they can continue to refine the technology.  At the moment they are limited by the amount of data they can read from the brain, send to a computer, interpret and send to the exoskeleton in real-time.  They have 350 milliseconds to go from thought to movement otherwise the system becomes difficult to control.  It means out of the 64 electrodes on each implant, the researchers are using only 32.  So there is still the potential to read the brain in more detail using more powerful computers and AI to interpret the information from the brain.  There are also plans to develop finger control to allow Thibault to pick up and move objects.  He has already used the implant to control a wheelchair.  Are there more sinister roles for this technology?  There are scientists investigating ways of using exoskeletons to enhance human abilities, a field known as transhumanism, rather than overcome paralysis.  This includes military applications.  \"We are absolutely not going in the direction of these extreme and stupid applications,\" Prof Benabid told the BBC.  \"Our job is to repair the injured patients who have lost function.\"  What do experts think?  Prof Tom Shakespeare, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said while this study presents a \"welcome and exciting advance\", proof of concept was a long way from usable clinical possibility.  \"A danger of hype always exists in this field. Cost constraints mean that hi-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.\"  Only 15% of people with disabilities had a wheelchair or other assistive devices, he said.

Since then the gallery has had several hit shows and is hosting this year's Turner Prize. But how much has it changed the surrounding town?  Tracey Emin grew up in Margate in the 1970s, when the north Kent resort was still attracting crowds of holidaymakers to its \"golden mile\" of sand, jellied eels, buckets and spades and Kiss Me Quick hats.  But by the 1980s the town had become a \"no-go zone\", she recalls.  As visitors found other destinations abroad, Margate - like other seaside resorts - had fallen into sharp decline.  At its lowest ebb, it was an unloved town of boarded-up shops, deserted trains, empty streets and derelict arcades. Its theme park had closed and it was home to some of the poorest communities in the country.  Emin has never wavered in her passionate support for her hometown, believing in its beauty, its sunsets and skies. These famously also inspired the Romantic artist JMW Turner, after whom both the Turner Prize and the Turner Contemporary are named.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Turner Contemporary opened amid a blaze of publicity in 2011  The brand new glass-clad Turner Contemporary opened its doors eight years ago on the seafront site of a cottage where JMW Turner had stayed.  Emin predicted visitors would discover a \"different, edgy, sexy\" town.  Since those first visitors arrived, the town has undergone a transformation.  The theme park Dreamland has reopened, the quaint streets of the Old Town have filled up with quirky cafes, stylish restaurants and vintage shops, and across the town, galleries, studios and cottage industries have opened.  Rambling old houses have become desirable again and even the gardens have been smartened up.  Now Margate makes the news for its hipsters, its London cool and celebrity residents, such as The Libertines frontman Pete Doherty.  Image copyright Alamy Image caption Trendy cafes are now a feature of the Old Town  Figures show thousands of people visit the town each day.  \"Now there are new restaurants, there's a vintage theme park, there are thousands of people on the streets, people on the beaches, people on the harbour arm, people dancing, people swimming, the caves have reopened, the shell grotto has never had so many visitors, the trains are so busy you can't get a seat,\" says Emin.  But despite the success questions remain whether Margate's regeneration is skin deep.  Dan Thompson, an artist, lives in the 1960s tower block Arlington House that overlooks the railway station and sees the crowds of visitors arriving in the town each day.  He welcomes the \"fancy galleries\" but says Margate still has social problems that the gallery has not improved.  \"We've still got to make that real, deep lasting change,\" he says.  Economic data bears this out. Latest figures issued last week by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government show the area around Turner Contemporary is still one of the 1% most deprived in the country.

Others claim the gallery does not do enough to help struggling artists.  Dr Jonathan Ward, who has researched the gallery's impact on the town, cites the story of a local artist as evidence.  \"She was putting on a show but she wasn't allowed to put her flyers for the show in Turner Contemporary because it would spoil their attractive and very thought-out, cool interior to have a row of flyers, so she went in the toilets and hid them there,\" he says.  \"There are clearly people in Margate doing work out of Turner Contemporary. One of the greatest things they're doing is the cafe is buying all fresh produce from a place up the road, so keeping some money in the local economy.  \"But I'm quite critical of Turner Contemporary because it's not done enough to support the local creative community.\"  But Emin, who is now the Royal Academy's professor of drawing, strongly disagrees.  She says the gallery's impact on Margate is proven by the footfall in the town and at the gallery. She also claims the gallery has led to more students studying GCSE and A-level art in the town.  \"That's the improvement people need,\" she says. \"Many wanted more from the money that was spent without realising the real effects. I don't agree with that.\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption JMW Turner was fascinated by the interplay between the sea and the light at Margate  In its first eight years, the gallery, under Victoria Pomery's directorship, has hosted big-name shows including Rodin's The Kiss and Emin's My Bed.  Its latest coup came on Saturday when it unveiled the Turner Prize shortlist to the public. Nearly 10,000 people came through its doors over the weekend, making it the gallery's busiest autumn yet.  In total it has received more than 3.3m visits since it opened in 2011 and in that time visitor numbers to Thanet - the council area Margate sits within - have risen by one million.  The local authority says tourists cite the gallery and Dreamland as their main reasons for visiting.  The area's economy has also grown by \u00a389m since 2011 and the number of jobs has increased from 5,477 to 7,950.  Some say the town's high-speed rail service, which since 2009 has made the town more attractive to London commuters, is responsible for much of this boom.  But it seems indisputable that the gallery itself has had a positive impact on the town too.  How much change has there been?  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite the gallery's success the town is still ranked among England's poorest communities  Official deprivation figures released in September show the area of Margate around Turner Contemporary was among the most deprived 1% of neighbourhoods in England.  As of 2019, it is the 139th most deprived out of more than 32,800 neighbourhoods, Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) figures show.  In 2010, it was 81st most deprived but it slipped further down the rankings in 2015 to 21st before its score changed again in the latest data.  The adjoining neighbourhood, Cliftonville West, was the 117th most deprived in England, an improvement on being ranked fourth most deprived in 2015, but still well within the 1% most deprived. In 2010 it was England's 33rd most deprived neighbourhood.  Rankings for deprivation are based on a combination of factors including income, employment, education, skills and training, health and disability, crime, housing and living environment.  Source: MHCLG  Dr Andrew Jackson, an expert in advertising, marketing and arts management, says research has shown half the people who visit Margate would not do so if the gallery was not there.  Local businesses even see a downturn when the gallery is between exhibitions, he adds.  Dr Jackson, who acts as a consultant to the gallery, says: \"That's a really clear indication their success depends on the gallery and its funding.\"  Kate Kneale, a designer who left London and moved to Marine Studios in Margate in 2009, has seen it all happen.  She remembers how the gallery opened in a \"broken, challenged\" town but said the gallery had \"played its part in spades\" in the town's success.  The town has also seen a passion for art sweep through its schools, according to Katie Green, at Ramsgate's Harbour Academy.  She said students were more openly talking about art, were more engaged in lessons and wanted to do art in their spare time. Year 7 and Year 9 pupils are also currently engaged in projects based at the gallery.  Meanwhile, the Margate Art School is launching its master of fine arts degree in October and attributes its uptake to the gallery's reputation and profile.  Director Uwe Derksen said: \"Turner helps the atmosphere. It helps to have the Turner Prize, it's an uplift. People think 'this is a place where I want to study'.\"  Emin herself is now based in a studio in her hometown following a career that has taken her across the globe.  She insists: \"Margate hasn't had a boom like this for 40 years and I do attribute it to the gallery, 100%.  \"This is because of art. This is only a good thing.\"  Image copyright Oscar Murillo/Lawrence Abu Hamdan/Helen Cammock/Ta Image caption Collective Conscience 2018 by Oscar Murillo, Walled Unwalled 2018 by Lawrence Abu Hamdan, The Long Note 2018 by Helen Cammock, DC Semiramis 2018 by Tai Shani  'Highest honour'  The Turner Prize is an annual award given to a visual artist born in or based in Britain. It is considered the British art world's highest honour.  It was established in 1984 to promote new developments in contemporary art and often brings fierce debate about artists and the definition of art.  The exhibition used to be held in London but now alternates yearly between Tate Britain and a gallery outside the capital.  In the 1990s, artists including Damien Hirst and Emin sparked controversy for the provocative, often conceptually-driven works they showcased.

The launch of the writer and activist's 2018 collection of essays, Feminists Don't Wear Pink (and Other Lies), saw a pop-up display assembled in Topshop's flagship store in London's Oxford Street.  But, just 20 minutes after it had opened, it was dismantled. Sir Philip Green, the chairman of the chain's parent company Arcadia personally ordered the removal of the exhibition when he saw it.  \"That was just such a big reminder that I do live in a very nice feminist bubble,\" Curtis tells BBC News, \"where people talk about their mental health all the time, and it's really great, and I don't mind living there, but it was a good reminder that these things are still quite controversial.\"  Curtis later received an apology from Topshop and the company donated \u00a325,000 to the UN charity Girl Up.  A year on, Curtis is back with a new book - It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and Other Lies). It tackles the subject of mental health conditions - particularly anxiety and depression, which Curtis has experienced herself.  Fearne Cotton, Emma Thompson, Davina McCall, Naomi Campbell and many other high-profile figures have each contributed a short chapter, essay or poem to the book.  Image copyright Getty/Reuters Image caption Lena Dunham, Simon Amstell and Reggie Yates have all contributed to the book  But the 24-year-old makes a clear distinction between mental illness itself, and the shame surrounding it. She argues the latter is a significant problem which could be easily avoided with better understanding in society.  \"By the time I was 19 I'd shut myself off from everyone in my life,\" she explains. \"I felt so ashamed of what I was going through.  \"I'd barely talked to my family about it, I had no friends, I was out of school, I was completely socially isolated. And while a lot of that was the mental illness itself, most of that was the shame. I felt like the only depictions I'd seen of mental illness before were people who'd had it define their lives, and that was who they were and they were in hospital forever and could never work, so I felt like that was me immediately.  \"And I think the second I started talking about this, I suddenly started getting all these messages from people saying 'I'm going through this too'... to me that's what this book is doing.  Some of the contributors in the book offer practical advice for keeping the mind healthy.  Emma Thompson's tips include taking a cold shower for the uplifting effect it gives the body, as well as avoiding staying up all night watching Netflix documentaries about serial killers. Davina McCall's advice includes being willing to let people see your emotional vulnerability, while equally not being afraid to cut out toxic people from your life.  Image copyright Getty Images  Miranda Hart writes about how she started to realise she was an introvert and how it contributed to her anxiety and chronic fatigue. \"Some introverts are loud at times and love to perform (hello!) and we aren't always shy,\" she writes.  \"But there are so many things about being an introvert that are HUGE light-bulb moments of 'Oh, THAT's why I hate big groups of people and must only socialise in small, quieter ways.' 'Oh, THAT's why I need to be alone so much to regain my energy.' 'Oh, THAT's why I hate open-plan offices.'\"  However, critics argue that the more young people are aware of conditions such as anxiety and depression, the more they are likely to assume they have them - when in fact they may be experiencing the normalities of being young and insecure.  \"Frequently the public is told that youngsters are suffering from an epidemic of panic, depression and suicidal thoughts,\" wrote Charlotte Gill in The Spectator. \"We live in a correctional culture which leads us to believe that anything uncomfortable must automatically be wrong and seen to by a doctor.\"  \"There are lots of people that do suffer from mental illness and they must be taken seriously and they must get treatment and speak to friends, family and where necessary speak to medical experts,\" said Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain.  \"But it seems to me a lot of people in this modern era now are being led into the thought process that every part of life's travails - the normal rough and tumble of life - now has to be categorised as mental illness, and I don't think that is helpful either.\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Curtis says the \"shame\" surrounding mental health could be easily avoided  Curtis argues that this strand of opinion only strengthens her case that better understanding of mental health is needed.  \"From a scientific point of view, we are so early in this journey,\" she says, pointing out that anxiety was only recognised as diagnosable disorder in 1980. \"When we look at stats on anxiety and say people are more anxious than before, we don't know that - it's just that people are talking about it more. Actually, when you look through any piece of literature or art or film, you can see that these issues have been going on forever.  \"The other thing is, if you've ever had a panic attack on the train, or you've never been able to get out of bed because you're so depressed, the idea that you'd choose that is so ridiculous - just getting the courage to talk about these issues is the hardest thing.\"  In the book, Davina McCall acknowledges it can be hard for some to understand mental illness when \"we are living in the most privileged time in history\". It's a point echoed by Morgan, who has said: \"This is statistically the safest time to ever be alive, there are fewer wars, it's the healthiest time to be alive, people are living longer, there is less poverty globally, these are things we should be bursting with positivity about.\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Curtis acknowledges she benefitted from having a privileged background - her parents are writer Richard Curtis and broadcaster Emma Freud  But, Curtis counters: \"We are talking about a young generation who are going through something very different to what Piers Morgan's generation went through. When I was 12, I went into a history class, our teacher came in and said, 'there's been a financial crisis, none of you are going to get jobs'. And that has been the narrative my whole life.  \"And I think we also have more access to the news, all young people have been bombarded with since they could read is that bad things are happening, unemployment rates are increasing, and added to that there's climate change, the #MeToo movement, and maybe we do have to accept that we're in a situation where everyday stress for young people actually might be anxiety, because it's so intense, and maybe that is something worthy of addressing.\"  Throughout her teenage years, a spine operation for scoliosis left Curtis with chronic back pain and meant she had to use a wheelchair for long periods. It meant much of her adolescence was affected by physical, as well as mental, problems.  She acknowledges that coming from a privileged background (her parents are Love Actually writer and director Richard Curtis and broadcaster Emma Freud) meant help was available to her in a way it may not be to everyone.  \"I went through hell from the ages of 14 to 20, I wouldn't have wished it on anyone. But within that, I always had access to treatment, my parents always understood what I was going through, I always had different therapists that I could be trying.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson will now feel complete.  She has been among the best heptathletes in the world for several years and touted as a star of the discipline since winning the World Youth Championships a decade ago.  She has had an abundance of emotional support, ranging from her close bond with her mother - highlighted by a touching letter during the 2016 Olympics - to affection from friends such as Killing Eve actress Jodie Comer and athlete boyfriend Andrew Pozzi.  She has had UK Sport funding for most of her career and supplemented that with several commercial deals.  But there had been a major hole in her life, one that wasn't filled until a balmy night inside Doha's Khalifa Stadium.  That was when she comprehensively defeated defending champion and main rival Nafissatou Thiam to win heptathlon gold at the World Championships.  Johnson-Thompson triumphed in style with a British-record 6,981 points, beating silver medallist Thiam by 304 points and setting four personal bests in the process.  \"She has slayed the dragon and banished the demons,\" Michael Johnson, a former world and Olympic 200m and 400m champion, told BBC Sport. \"What you used to see between events was a worry that the demons are going to come back. She has now overcome that.\"  Her accession to the throne was expected to be faster and smoother, but there was to be plenty of heartache before she reached the top.  Having won the World Youth title in 2009, it was expected to be only a matter of time before she followed 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis and eventually take over from Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, who dominated the event from 2009 to 2015.  The perfect stepping stone to this seemed London 2012, for which she was selected alongside Ennis-Hill and Louise Hazel.  Actress Jodie Comer, who has just won an Emmy for her performance in Killing Eve, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson were classmates at St Julie's School in Liverpool  There were PBs in the 100m hurdles, high jump and 200m but she was last in the shot put and struggled in the javelin. At the age of 19, KJT - as she was starting to be affectionately known - had finished a very creditable 13th.  She said of the experience: \"That stadium is always going to hold a special place in my heart and it definitely brings back a lot of emotions. In 2012 I was just going along with the wind really.\"  Ennis-Hill, who has watched Johnson-Thompson since she was competing at youth level, told BBC Sport: \"She's changed massively since those days of London 2012.  \"She was relatively inexperienced, had fantastic raw talent, but hadn't understood how to put the events together.\"  The Liverpool-born athlete was starting to close the gap on Ennis-Hill and the rest in subsequent events. At the 2013 World Championships she came fifth and then won the traditional multi-eventers' Gotzis meeting in 2014 where a 19-year-old Thiam came fifth.  Just as she looked ready to make what seemed the natural move to a major global podium position, the incline started to get a little slippery.  Media playback is not supported on this device 2015: Johnson-Thompson's day ends in tears  Johnson-Thompson fell apart at the 2015 Worlds with three fouls in the long jump, having stood second after the first day behind eventual champion Ennis-Hill. Below-par performances in her Achilles heel events - shot put and javelin - then cost her a medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.  \"I remember doing the lap of honour with the girls in Rio and Kat was broken there, questioning whether she wanted to continue in the event,\" said Ennis-Hill.  That was Ennis-Hill's final appearance on the big stage as she signed off with silver, but looking down at her during the medal ceremony was Thiam - the athlete Johnson-Thompson comfortably defeated two years previously.  She decided to make a radical change, cutting ties with long-time coach Mike Holmes and joining Betrand Valcin in Montpellier, France.  In a revealing interview with the Telegraph after the 2016 Olympics, she said she had \"not enjoyed anything in the past two years\".  Ennis-Hill believes Johnson-Thompson's bold changes are what has helped her turn a big corner.  \"Within the heptathlon it takes a long time to master all the events and then also bring them together in a championships,\" said Ennis-Hill.  \"You will have disappointment and real setbacks but there comes an end point where everything eventually comes together.  \"You can see she has grown massively in confidence having made huge changes by employing a new coach and moving to France.\"  A fairytale ending inside the Olympic Stadium - where it all began - at the London 2017 World Championships would have been fitting, but once again a major medal eluded her as she underperformed in the high jump with 1.80m. In the individual competition she managed 1.95m.  But the gods finally smiled on her last year. It started with the World Indoor pentathlon title, before Commonwealth Games gold and then the Europeans, where she finally gave Thiam a stiff test when taking silver.  It was the satisfaction of finishing only 57 points behind the Belgian, having also struggled with a calf problem, that gave her new-found confidence.  Johnson-Thompson was enjoying competing again, and said at the time: \"This is definitely one of the favourite performances of my career, despite not winning.\"  She then set her target: \"Thiam is the best female athlete in any sport. She's won Olympic, world and European titles and got over 7,000 points. I feel if I did all that I would want to, to be called the best in the world.\"  The big Liverpool FC supporter began to inch closer when she smashed her heptathlon personal best at Gotzis in May with a winning score of 6,813.  Media playback is not supported on this device Watch how Johnson-Thompson won heptathlon gold  The elements now seemed in place for an assault on the world title; all she needed was to avoid mistakes and hope for some luck.  The brilliant personal best in the opening 100m hurdles on Wednesday was followed by an even better PB in the shot put.  Toni Minichiello, Ennis-Hill's former coach, told BBC Sport the \"pivotal event\" would be the javelin - and it proved to be.  Johnson threw another PB of 43.93m and Thiem, suffering from an elbow injury, failed to get the advantage needed over Johnson-Thompson going into the 800m. The Briton, knowing she had all but won gold, stayed relaxed in the final event before officially dethroning her rival.  Ennis-Hill added: \"To come back and deliver in this way with all these personal bests is incredible.  \"You have to get to the lowest point, the breaking point. She got to that and she made big changes and decisions and they are the reason she has gone on to improve and become world champion now.  \"Once you win the first world title it gives you confidence and self-belief. It impacts how you perform in the next competitions and how people look at you.  \"Thiam will fight back and fight harder at the Tokyo Olympics but Kat will have the massive edge she's never had before.\"  Media playback is not supported on this device 'I want more' - Johnson-Thompson not fully content after World Championship gold  'Amazing story for sport' - social media reaction  Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher: \"Brilliant from Johnson-Thompson.

His big concern is the planet and his inspiration is Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.  \"This is about our future,\" the 24-year-old explains, echoing the teenage campaigner. He says he began to read about climate change after seeing her protests, and realised the threat.  \"Russia is the world's fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and our government won't act without pressure.

Environmental activism is not big in Russia, where many feel they have more pressing things to fret about. High prices, poverty and corruption all regularly top the lists of concerns, way above climate change.  Then there's the fact that politicians often hail the economic benefits of global warming: opening up the Northern Sea Route, for example, for both shipping and energy exploration in the Arctic.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"You are failing us\" - Greta tells world leaders  Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter, of course.  And the idea of getting warmer is unlikely to worry people too much - not in a country where for half of the year your nostril hairs freeze as soon as you step into the street.  Are Russians waking up to climate change?  Many would struggle to do much to help halt climate change, even if they did care.  In most homes you have to open a window in winter to regulate the heating because radiators are turned on centrally, full blast.  Recycling does now exist in some places and it's improving. But it's still haphazard at best and voluntary. As one colleague once explained, memorably: \"In Russia, we have lots of trees.\"  But as of this summer, there are a lot fewer of them.  Wildfires swept forests in Siberia and far eastern regions this year on an unprecedented scale. Those, and mass floods, were blamed on climate change.  Image caption A satellite image shows wildfires in Siberia during the summer  The melting permafrost has also become a more common topic of debate.  Even President Putin, who suggested Greta Thunberg consider the \"reality\" of developing countries' ambitions when she lectured on climate change, has expressed concern that Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the average worldwide.  Three years after signing the Paris climate accord, the government has suddenly ratified it.  Russia seems to be waking up, belatedly, to the threat.  But climate protester Arshak Makichyan believes the harsh reaction to Greta Thunberg suggests the authorities are anxious not to be pushed into action.  \"I think they're afraid the climate protests will grow here and they can't argue with the science,\" the young violinist says. \"They're attacking Greta, because that's easier.\"  Image copyright EPA Image caption Last Friday's Moscow protest as part of the global climate strike was small, but not insignificant  The Friday pickets are still tiny.

So, what are the laws on abortion in the UK, how are they changing and how many are carried out?  What is the abortion law in England, Scotland and Wales?  Abortions can take place in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Scotland and Wales.  However, they have to be approved by two doctors. They must agree having the baby would pose a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman than a termination.  Abortions were illegal before the the introduction of the 1967 Abortion Act, which initially allowed them to take place up to 28 weeks. This was reduced to 24 weeks in 1990.  Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed only if:  the woman's life is in danger  there is a severe fetal abnormality  the woman is at risk of grave physical and mental injury  Since 2018, women in England have been allowed to take the second of two early abortion pills at home, rather than in a clinic. This brings the rules in line with Scotland and Wales.  What is the law on abortion in Northern Ireland?  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sarah Ewart challenged Northern Ireland's abortion laws in the High Court  Abortions are allowed in Northern Ireland only if:  a woman's life is at risk  there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health  An 1861 law made it a criminal offence to procure a miscarriage. In 1945, an exception was added to say abortion could be permitted to preserve the mother's life.  But rape, incest or diagnoses of fatal fetal abnormality - where medics believe the baby will die before, during or shortly after birth - are not grounds for a legal abortion.  Northern Ireland's abortion law was challenged in the High Court by Sarah Ewart. She was told she could not have a legal abortion, in 2013, even though doctors said her fetus would not survive outside the womb.  She travelled to England for a termination and spoke of the trauma and expense that had caused her.  In the High Court, Mrs Justice Keegan found in Mrs Ewart's favour.  Abortion is already due to be decriminalised in Northern Ireland from 21 October. This is because MPs in London voted for legislation that required abortion laws to be changed - unless Northern Ireland's government is restored beforehand.  Women from Northern Ireland can already have free abortions in England, Scotland and Wales.  In 2018, 1,053 travelled to undergo the procedure in England and Wales.  How many abortions are there?  In 2018, there were 205,295 legal abortions in England and Wales.  A total of 4,687 abortions for non-residents were carried out, a slight increase on the previous year.  The large majority took place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. About two-thirds were medically induced, which involves taking two types of tablet to end an unwanted pregnancy.  In Scotland, there were 13,286 abortions.  There were 32 medical abortions in Northern Ireland in 2017-18.  Number of legal abortions England and Wales, non-residents included  What is the law in other countries?  In the US, a number of Republican-led states have passed stricter abortion legislation this year but none of those laws has taken effect. This is because a number of legal challenges are due to take place.  In Georgia, for example, a judge has temporarily blocked a strict new abortion law that would have banned terminations as early as six weeks into pregnancy.  The law, signed in May by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, was scheduled to come into effect on 1 January.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters gathered outside the Georgia State Capitol, in Atlanta, in May  Abortion was recently decriminalised across Australia, after New South Wales voted in favour of changing its laws.  Previously, abortions were allowed there only if a doctor ruled there was a \"serious\" risk to a woman's health. The new law makes it legal for terminations to be carried out across the country up to 22 weeks into a pregnancy.  In the European Union, there are no common laws on abortion - but in several European countries terminating a pregnancy can still risk punishment.  Around the world, some countries have total bans, including Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Malta.  And Cuba and Uruguay are the only places in Latin America region where women can have abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy regardless of circumstances.", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T00:02:29", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49927625", "title": "Why a row over jets could raise the cost of whisky", "text": "Image copyright Speyside Distillers Image caption Patricia Dillon is managing director of Speyside Distillers in Scotland  Scotch whisky should, in theory, have little do with planes - except perhaps as a mid-flight tipple.  Which is why independent distillery boss Patricia Dillon wants to know why the Scotch whisky industry has been \"dragged into\" a row about aeroplanes.  The US has been given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn of EU exports because of illegal subsidies Europe provided to jet-maker Airbus.  Top of America's tariff list is Scotch whisky, which faces a levy of 25%.  \"We're being dragged into a trade dispute,\" says Ms Dillon, managing director of Speyside Distillers in the Scottish Highlands. \"It's about aircraft and it is nothing to do with us or Scotch whisky consumers.\"  The US is big business for the Scotch whisky industry. The value of exports from the UK has grown from \u00a3280m in 1994 to more than \u00a31bn last year, according to HMRC.  And for the last 25 years, selling Scotch whisky to the US has been tariff-free.  This means that US businesses have not had to pay an import tax on Scotch shipped from the UK.  For Ms Dillon, America was the next major market Speyside Distillers wanted to conquer.  The maker of Spey single malt currently exports about 10% of its whisky to the US.  Its biggest market by far is Asia where the majority of the 600,000 litres of single malt it produces each year is sent.  \"The plan was that the US was an emerging market for us to enter,\" says Ms Dillon.  She says the company has spent the last two years \"travelling backwards and forwards\" looking for the right importer in the US.  Image copyright Speyside Distillers Image caption Speyside Distillers is based in the Scottish Highlands  \"And now because of these tariffs, we have to reposition ourselves to decide whether after the years that we've spent working on this and appointing an importer, do we want to grow this market when our margins are going to be getting eaten up by a 25% tariff?\" she asks.  The levies are not due to come into force until 18 October.  Ms Dillon says: \"The UK government must now work with both sides to urge a negotiated settlement and to ensure that these damaging tariffs do not take effect.\"  'Difficult'  For Simon Cotton, chief executive of Johnstons of Elgin, a producer of cashmere and fine wool knitwear, the tariffs have tipped his industry in favour of the UK's biggest rival, Italy.  He points out that while 25% tariffs are proposed on cashmere knitwear produced in the UK, no such levies have been imposed on the Italian industry.  \"It makes the playing field a little more difficult,\" says Mr Cotton.  Image copyright Johnstons of Elgin Image caption Johnstons of Elgin makes knitwear made from cashmere and fine wool  The 222-year-old Scottish company, which employs just over 1,000 people, has been selling its knitwear to the US for more than a century.  It is Johnstons of Elgin's third biggest market after Europe and Japan.  Despite the advantage potentially being handed to Italy's knitwear industry, Mr Cotton is hoping that his customers will remain loyal.  However, he admits that if the 25% tariff does come into force later this month, some of the cost will be passed on to consumers.  \"We certainly won't be able to able to absorb all of it,\" he says.  On the upside, prices will not rise before Christmas because the company has already shipped its good for the festive period.  But Mr Cotton says things could be different when it comes to its orders in January.  In the meantime, he says: \"We are still hoping there will be some sort of postponement or reversal.\"  Wider impact  It is not just UK businesses potentially facing tougher times ahead.  The US is also planning to implement 25% tariffs on EU goods such as pecorino, prosciutto and parmesan.  The US Specialty Food Association says the move will impact 14,000 specialist food retailers across the country.  Salvatore Di Palo knows his family's Italian food store can withstand a lot.  It has survived in New York City for more than 100 years through the Great Depression, both World Wars, and a devastating 2012 hurricane.  But he says the new tariffs \"will be another disaster\".  \"It won't put us out of business but it will make it that much more difficult,\" he adds.  Image caption Salvatore Di Palo's family has run their New York City shop for more than 100 years  Mr Di Palo estimates that his family imports 95% of the products in the store.  The higher duties will not apply to everything such as Italian wines and olive oil.  But the tariffs will hit the shop's many varieties of meat and cheese, which are the main draw for so many Di Palo Fine Food customers.  Mr Di Palo says he expects he - and the producers in Italy - will absorb some of the hit, sparing buyers a full 25% price increase.  But a modest rise is likely, and deciding to disdain fancy European imports won't solve the problem, he warns.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Imports of Italian prosciutto into the US are facing a 25% tariff  As demand shifts to American cheese, he predicts those producers will take the opportunity to raise prices also.  \"It doesn't just affect me. It's going to affect everyone,\" he says.

It can actually be, maybe the most popular park in a city,\" Mr Ingels tells me enthusiastically.  Amager Bakke is billed as one of the cleanest waste-to-energy plants in the world, thanks to technology that filters its emissions.  It was switched on in 2017, and this Friday the ski area opens to the public. The project has been almost a decade in the making and cost \u20ac550m ($600m; \u00a3490m) to build.  Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Some residents like the idea of a ski slope in the neighbourhood  Bakke means hill in Danish. For a country whose highest point is a mere 170m (550ft), the new 85m summit has become a landmark and has also stirred debate about how best to handle the city's waste.  \"There has been quite a lot of construction challenges,\" explains Christian Ingels, the general manager of Copenhill. The rooftop is leased to his firm which runs the recreational area.  Extra precautions had to be in place, before the public could be allowed to ski above the incinerator and high-pressure steam system.  \"It is the first time anyone [has] ventured out on this path\u2026 a lot of safety installations have been made.\"  From the plant's rooftop there are views over the city, harbour and the heavy industry close by. Apartment blocks stand just a couple of hundred metres away.  Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Up to 300 trucks arrive at Amager Bakke each day  Soon skiers will be able to whizz down the 450m slope that wraps around the aluminium-clad building. Around 50-60,000 skiers are expected each year.  Residents nearby that I spoke to seemed positive about the project.  \"To be totally honest, I don't even think about it - that it's waste,\" says Cecilie Sjoeberg, who has lived in the area for five years.  \"You can go skiing in your backyard. Not a lot of people can do that in a city.\"  \"I think it's a good idea, it's good to combine those things,\" says fellow resident, Hanne Mendel.  \"I can see from my bedroom the smoke coming out from the pipe and I believe it's clean.\"  The plant is run by waste management firm, Amager Resource Centre (ARC) and owned by five local municipalities, while engineering firms Babcock and Wilcox Vollund built the main infrastructure for the plant.  Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Chief engineer Peter Blinksbjerg  Up to 300 truckloads of waste arrive at the plant each day, from households and businesses across the metropolitan area. It is the rubbish left over after Copenhagen's waste has been sorted for recycling.  Two huge furnaces burn the waste at temperatures of around 1,000C. \"You have water coming in to these vaults,\" explains ARC's chief engineer Peter Blinksbjerg. \"We boil the water and produce steam.\"  A turbine and generator produce electricity which is fed into grid. The leftover energy from the steam is used to provide heating for 72,000 homes, through a system called district heating, which is common throughout Denmark.  It is a series of advanced filters that ARC claims makes this facility cleaner than others. Particles and pollutants from the smoke are removed, and a process called Selective Catalytic Reduction breaks down harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) into nitrogen and water vapour.  \"I have heard of only one more plant in the world having this kind of catalytic reduction of NOx,\" Mr Blinksbjerg says.  Image copyright Copenhill Image caption Big safety hurdles had be cleared to allow skiing on a power plant  The resulting gas is released through a large chimney on the roof.  \"Coming out of the stack is nitrogen, which is also in the air, there's a little leftover oxygen, some water vapour and then carbon dioxide,\" says Mr Blinksbjerg.  With high costs and early technical issues, the plant has not been problem-free. The main criticism is that it is simply too big and there isn't enough local waste to feed the huge furnaces.  \"It has never been constructed in a size which fitted the waste in the the five municipalities in Copenhagen,\" says Jens Peter Mortensen, an environmental expert at The Danish Society for Nature Conservation.  \"We argued that of course we should recycle, then we should reuse. So there was no reason for constructing such a big incinerator.\"  ARC is importing waste from abroad to feed the giant furnaces. By 2024, it forecasts that almost half of the material it burns will be imported waste and biomass.  Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Waste has to be imported to feed the giant Amager Bakke furnaces  Mr Blinksbjerg argues it is greener for foreign waste to be incinerated, than to dump it in landfill.  He argues that emissions from incineration are lower. \"So in taking waste from the UK to here, we're reducing the greenhouse effect.\"  In Europe, Nordic countries (except for Iceland) have the highest proportion of waste used to generate electricity, resulting in low uses of landfill, according to the Confederation of European Waste to Energy Plants (CEWEP).  The European Union has set targets for countries to recycle 65% of municipal waste and reduce rates of landfill to 10%, by 2035.  That raises the question: should other countries follow the Nordic example and burn waste too?  More Technology of Business  CEWEP's managing director, Ella Stengler, says not all waste can be recycled effectively. \"For this part of the waste, rather then sending it to landfill, the best and most sustainable treatment of the waste is to turn it into energy, into electricity and heat for cities, for homes and industries.\"  Burning waste creates carbon dioxide emissions. However it is argued that the methane emitted from landfill has a much higher greenhouse effect than the same volume of CO2.  It is also a revenue earner. \"It's pretty much the only fuel where people will actually pay you to burn it,\" says Peter Jones from environmental consultancy, Eunomia.  Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Advanced filters keep pollution from Amager Bakke to a minimum  However as an energy source, it's not particularly effective. \"You're talking about something that has about the third of the energy content compared with wood. And considerably less compared with fossil fuels. So you have to burn a lot of stuff to produce much energy,\" says Mr Jones.  While it is greener than burning fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas, he adds: \"As we move on to a greater share of renewables in the electricity mix, the case for incineration gets weaker.\"  Environmental groups don't want incinerators. They argue for greater prevention, reuse and recycling.  \"There are better ways to produce energy than burning waste. They use a lot of plastic because plastic is calorific, and paper and wood also. All those are recyclable if they are separately collected,\" says Piotr Barczak, from the European Environmental Bureau in Brussels.  \"With the current situation with climate change, we have to look at any facility that generates CO2 - including incineration.\"", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-03T01:12:08", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49837310", "title": "John Humphrys: 'I'm hugely argumentative by instinct'", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Humphrys: \"I don't feel any need to get back in front of a microphone or indeed a camera\"  After 32 years of co-presenting BBC Radio 4's Today, John Humphrys knew exactly how he wanted his final programme to sound.  \"I had told the big boss that I wanted to leave without any fuss at all,\" he explains. \"At five minutes to nine on the morning of my last programme, I would say, 'That's it from us, oh and by the way, this is my last programme.

But he says he was \"absolutely not in the slightest\" bit tempted to hang on, adding that \"there would always be another reason for staying a little bit longer\".  Image caption Humphrys presenting Today with (clockwise from top left) Sue McGregor, Brian Redhead, Mishal Husain and James Naughtie  There's a recurring theme in the articles that were written about Humphrys around the time of his exit. Words like \"Rottweiler\" and \"grumpy\" crop up a lot.  \"With all the boss class he was irascible, impatient and magnificently argumentative,\" wrote former editor Rod Liddle in The Sunday Times. \"For the past 20 years or more, senior figures wanted him out. They considered his approach too macho.\"  In The New Statesman, another former editor, Roger Mosey, said Humphrys \"excelled at the big gladiatorial combats; in his prime, there was nobody better at asking the questions listeners wanted to hear\".  Now that both Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman have left the BBC, there's a suggestion that their combative style of interviewing may have had its day. Indeed, Radio 4 PM presenter Evan Davis has criticised those types of interviews as \"worn out\" and \"not a particular public service\".  Humphrys discusses this at length in his memoirs, which are published this week. \"I don't want the audience to think we presenters and the politicians we interview are best mates, or even friends,\" he writes in A Day Like Today. \"Evan often uses their first names on air. I have always refused to do that and I wish they did not use ours.\"  His own impatience during interviews, he now explains to BBC News, is largely down to the politicians who he says \"refuse to engage on any level at all\" - exchanges he finds \"unrewarding and rather pointless\".  Image copyright HarperCollins Image caption Humphrys pictured with British forces at their military base in Basra, Iraq, in 2003  \"It's when you ask them a perfectly reasonable question, and they employ one of these gambits to avoid answering it, and you can see they've had media training or they've been told by their spin doctor not to answer it. The audience sees through it. I got more complaints about politicians who simply refused to answer the question than anything else.\"  But he also points out that changes in interviewing styles over the years do not necessarily mean presenters nowadays are any less effective than they used to be.  \"Justin [Webb] is every bit as tough as I was,\" Humphrys says of one of Today's remaining hosts. \"He may have a slightly more emollient approach and he might get into an interview rather more gently than I did, but you realise if you're listening that he knows what's going on, he does his homework, and you wait for the killer question, and it will come.\"  Humphrys and Webb's warm relationship was evidenced by the fact that Webb was chosen to co-host the 76-year-old's final programme. But he also acknowledged Humphrys' occasional bad temper, writing in the Radio Times that Humphrys wouldn't hesitate to \"shout\" and \"throw things\" if he was unhappy.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Humphrys interviewed former Prime Minister David Cameron for his last 08:10 interview  \"Untrue. Justin will hear from my lawyer,\" Humphrys replies jokingly (we think) when this is put to him. \"Look,\" he continues, \"I get worked up before and sometimes even during the programme - I was wholly engaged and I couldn't do it by half.  \"I am hugely argumentative by instinct, I'm fairly combative - not physically - and if I see something of which I disapprove, if I don't like the running order or brief, I will say so. And with some people, I'm able to have perfectly rational and sensible conversations. With other people, for whatever reason, personality clashes or whatever, I will occasionally lose my temper. I'm always sorry when I do.\"  How many times has he threatened to resign?  \"Hang on a minute, how long have we got?\" He jokingly pretends to count on both hands. \"I'm afraid, rather childishly, I have threatened to resign once or twice - quite a few times probably.\"  He does not recall many specific examples, but Charlotte Edwardes of The Times reported in 2016 that one such occasion was when Humphrys found out he wouldn't be presenting on the morning of the EU referendum result. (In the end, he did present that programme, with Montague.)  Image copyright HarperCollins Image caption As a young reporter, Humphrys reported on the Liverpool dock strikes  Humphrys' memoirs include his reflections on how journalism, and the BBC, have changed since he began presenting Today in 1987.  One of the most significant developments of recent years has been the annual publication of BBC stars' salaries after pressure from the government. That has led to all kinds of issues for the corporation, not least the gender pay discrepancies which emerged.  Some presenters, such as Graham Norton, took issue with the list's publication, but Humphrys says he's \"always been happy with it\".  \"And I've always been puzzled by the BBC's hitherto refusal to do so. I've never been ashamed of how much I earned. There was a time when I was earning a very large amount indeed.\" In 2016/17, Humphrys earned between \u00a3600,000-\u00a3650,000 before he took a pay cut to around \u00a3290,000. \"But the licence payer has a right to know.\"  However, since the BBC began revealing salaries, it has lost some of its biggest names to the commercial sector, including Chris Evans, Simon Mayo and Eddie Mair. Although not the only factor in their exits, director general Tony Hall referred to the lists as a \"poacher's charter\".  \"Well, let it [be one],\" Humphrys replies. \"Look, if someone wants to employ Eddie Mair, what's to stop them ringing him up and saying, 'How much you earning Eddie? Oh, well we can double that'. It's a market, and if they want to take him from the BBC, fine.\"  Image caption Several past and present Today presenters and editors joined Humphrys for his final programme  His relationship with Mair, incidentally, is shown in the book to have been strained.  Humphrys recalls an occasion when the former PM presenter fronted an item about the leaking of an off-air conversation between Humphrys and BBC North America editor Jon Sopel, in which they appeared to make light of the gender gap revealed by the star salaries list. Humphrys admits he \"went ballistic\" about how Mair tackled the events on air, without allowing him a right of reply.  He does, however, express regret and \"takes full responsibility\" for his conversation with Sopel itself. \"I naively believed that the people you work with are not sitting there listening furtively to your conversations that you think are little private chats at four o'clock in the morning, when you're both taking the mickey out of each other. But I do find the reaction to be preposterous.\"  Humphrys adds that he \"has a vague suspicion\" of who leaked the recording, but declines to name names.  'Absolute tosh'  Notably, Humphrys is not on Twitter, something practically unthinkable for a journalist in 2019. The social media platform is a crucial tool for reporters.  Considering the pasting Humphrys gave George Entwistle in 2012 over the former director general's failure to stay across news headlines and spot the Newsnight scandal sooner, is it not hypocritical for Humphrys himself to have refused to join such a platform?  \"It's a very good question, but let me throw it back to you,\" he says. \"If Donald Trump tweets something important, is it going to be in the newspapers and on every single outlet immediately? Yes. Do I read all of those newspapers? Yes. So the idea that by not spending eight hours of my day reading every idiotic and sometimes bizarre or offensive tweet I am somehow missing something is absolute tosh.\"  Image caption Humphrys' interview with George Entwistle contributed to the BBC director general's resignation  Safe to say, he will not be spending his radio retirement learning how to use social media. Instead, Humphrys is keen to have a few months off, although he will continue to present Mastermind on BBC Two.  The most important question, of course, is whether he'd consider doing Strictly Come Dancing now he's free from the constraints of being a serious news presenter.  \"I have been asked twice over the years, and the answer each time was no. The answer remains no,\" he says. \"Look, poor old John Sergeant made a fool of himself. He's a great mate of mine and, moreover, he turned making a fool of himself into a very successful career. So good on him, but not for me.  \"And anyway, I've got two left feet.\"  John Humphrys: A life in journalism  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Humphrys presented the Nine O'Clock News with Julia Somerville before joining Today", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T21:46:23", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/49940990", "title": "World Athletics Championships: GB 4x100m teams reach finals, Dalilah Muhammad wins 400m hurdles", "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device World Athletics Championships: GB win men's 4x100m semi-final in new world leading time  2019 World Athletics Championships Venue: Khalifa International Stadium, Doha Dates: 27 September-6 October Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live; Live streams, clips and text commentary online.  Dina Asher-Smith's hopes of a third 2019 World Championships medal remained intact as both Britain's 4x100m relay teams qualified for Saturday's finals.

USA's Dalilah Muhammad set a world record for the second time this year as she won the women's 400m hurdles final.  Following much scrutiny over the small crowds at the event, the Khalifa Stadium was almost full to capacity on Friday as the Qataris cheered on home favourite Mutaz Essa Barshim who defended his men's high jump title.  Smooth progression for GB relay teams  Asher-Smith, the 200m champion and 100m silver medallist, will be brought into the quartet for the final after sitting out Friday's heat.  She relied on Asha Philip, Imani-Lara Lansiquot, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryll Neita and they kept their composure to bring the baton safely around in a season's best time of 42.25 seconds.  At the World Relays earlier in the year, Nelson was involved in a baton-exchange error, but her exchange with Neita, on the anchor leg, was faultless.  Neita told BBC Sport: \"We've practised so hard. We've had an amazing camp coming into this. I feel like we're moving away from the technical side and moving in to the trust.  \"We all trust each other.

The British men's team of Adam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake were also impressive as they won their race with clear distance between themselves and the Americans, who included 100m champion Christian Coleman and came third with Brazil second.  Gemili, fourth in the men's 200m, told BBC Sport: \"I'm actually good. I feel really fresh. It's always an honour to come out with these guys. We were looking for redemption, especially myself and Zharnel, after what happened in the individuals.\"  Great Britain captain Kilty added: \"We knew the key to this was relaxation.

Just 12 months after battling to avoid relegation, the Red Devils have stunned the English rugby league establishment to book a meeting with St Helens at Old Trafford on Saturday, 12 October.  Ex-Wigan prop Gil Dudson's try helped put Salford 12-0 up at the break.  Another ex-Warriors forward Lee Mossop also touched down to seal a famous win.  Former New Zealand and Samoa centre Krisnan Inu crucially contributed 16 points with the boot, with his composure in landing two early penalties setting up the little-fancied Red Devils for one of Super League's most famous upsets.  Dudson's first-half try and further four-pointers from Joey Lussick and Mossop put the visitors on their way to Old Trafford just after the hour mark, with a Bevan French try for Wigan coming as a late consolation effort.  Salford upset the odds  Less than 20 miles separate the two clubs in England's north west, but in terms of Super League pedigree there is a colossal gap - Wigan being a perennial force and one of the game's best-known clubs, while Salford have flirted with relegation and financial troubles in recent years.  Salford, however, have spent 2019 making a mockery of their underdog status.  They were expected to finish closer to the relegation places than the play-off spots, but surprised many by finishing third in the table and have now gone on to set up a showdown with Saints on Super League's showpiece occasion.  Wigan may have been the side more used to competing in big games, but a nervy start by the hosts was clinically exploited by a composed Salford outfit, with Inu kicking two early penalties before Dudson rolled over the line for the game's first try after 14 minutes.  It only got worse for the Warriors, with talismanic playmaker Tommy Leuluai forced off the field and out of the game with a head injury soon afterwards.  When Lussick squeezed over for Salford's second try, the score seemingly crushed Wigan's hopes of a fightback.  Much had been made of Jackson Hastings, the Australian-born half-back and Man of Steel favourite, facing his future employers.  And while he influenced a remarkable result, it was Salford captain Mossop - a Grand Final winner with the Warriors in 2013 - who capped an astonishing result and story by powering over for a try that underlined the Red Devils' dominance.  Salford head coach Ian Watson said it was an \"amazing\" feeling to \"go against the odds\".  \"I'm delighted for the players,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra. \"There are people in our club who probably never thought they'd grace a stage like Old Trafford or a Challenge Cup final ever again.  \"With the adversity we've faced over the past four or five years, it's unbelievable.\"  They will become only the eighth club to appear in a Super League Grand Final since it was introduced as the title-decider in 1998, and will face a St Helens side that finished 16 points clear of the rest at the end of the regular season.  Sad end to Wigan's title defence  Wigan, aiming to reach a sixth Grand Final in seven years, had been thrashed 40-10 by Saints a week earlier in what was their first shot at once again booking a return to the iconic home of Manchester United.  Errors plagued their game against a slick Salford outfit that also battled resiliently in defence, limiting Wigan - a side that had beaten them in each of their past eight meetings - to just a few fleeting threatening moments.  Defeat brought an end to an at times turbulent season for the Warriors, who made a poor start to life under Adrian Lam - winning just one of their opening six games.  Lam arrived as an interim replacement for Shaun Wane, taking a one-year contract as Wigan awaited the arrival of Shaun Edwards.  The succession plan at the DW Stadium looked a disastrous one in the early months of 2019, with the slow start compounded by the news in April that Edwards had decided against taking up the job from 2020.  Six months into the campaign, however, Wigan had recovered, moving into the play-off spots and Lam being rewarded with a one-year contract extension.  A run of 13 wins from 14 games took them to a play-off semi-final against St Helens last week, but heavy back-to-back defeats made for a miserable finish to their title defence.

The 19-year-old headed in from close range a minute from full-time, moments after Daniel Ayala had bundled home an equaliser for Boro.  Blues had dominated for long periods and created numerous chances with only Fran Villalba's first-half strike to show for it.  Defender Ayala looked to have rescued a point for the visitors before Bailey scored his first goal for Blues in just his third league appearance.  A draw would have been cruel on a Birmingham side who had 26 attempts at goal, compared to Boro's five.  The hosts had several chances to put the game to bed before Boro's leveller, but were denied by a string of sublime saves from visiting goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Kristian Pedersen also headed against the bar and Gary Gardner struck the post.  A disjointed Middlesbrough side created little going forward until Ayala's goal and remain with just two league victories this season.  As impressive as Birmingham were on the ball, led by 16-year-old Jude Bellingham in central midfield, Boro looked devoid of confidence.  Jonathan Woodgate's side, who stay 20th in the table, could go into the international break just a point and a place above the relegation zone depending on Saturday's results.  The winning margin could and should have been even wider, were it not for former Blues man Randolph's early heroics.  The Republic of Ireland international tipped over a fierce point-blank effort from Villalba with just a few minutes on the clock, before palming a skewed clearance from one of his own defenders for a corner.  Villalba, 21, eventually made Birmingham's pressure pay with the coolest of first-time finishes from just inside the box for his first Blues goal.  Boro looked slightly more of a threat in the second half, but almost found themselves two behind when substitute Gardner crashed a shot from the edge of the area off the inside of the post.  Just as they looked like settling for a 1-0 victory, Blues captain Harlee Dean dithered on the ball and Britt Assombalonga stole it off the defender to hang up a cross which Ayala could not miss.  However, more drama was to come as, just a few minutes after coming on to the pitch, Bailey calmly finished Dan Crowley's cross at the far post to give Blues their first win in four games.  Fran Villalba scored his first goal for Birmingham since joining from Valencia in the summer  Birmingham City head coach Pep Clotet told BBC WM:  \"I think it was an exceptional performance linked with a very good result.  \"We need to be very happy with that as I think the performance we gave the fans a couple of weeks ago here against Preston was a long way away from what we wanted.  \"We went away and worked very hard on how we wanted to play and we carried that out from the start tonight.  \"That's the kind of football we want to play and the fact we're doing it with a very young team means we're able to show the fans the future of the club is bright.\"  Middlesbrough manager Jonathan Woodgate told BBC Tees:  \"That's so frustrating to concede so soon after we equalised.  \"You get games like that in the Championship where you're getting bombarded from pillar to post.  \"Darren Randolph has produced save after save. That isn't my type of team going out there not winning second balls or competing for crosses.  \"Is it a lack of confidence? I believe the players are good enough and I'll keep on going with them as I believe in them and I'll remain positive with them.  \"But if they don't pull their fingers out, we'll end up down the bottom of the table and we'll stay there.

England face Argentina at the World Cup on Saturday with a quarter-final place at stake - and, four years after being knocked out in the group stage, the official line from the England camp in Japan is clear: take nothing for granted.  England's World Cup tilt has so far resembled an old-school computer game. A breeze through the first two levels, a tougher one next, a harder one still beyond.  Fight through all seven in seven weeks and the greatest prize in the sport will be theirs, but no-one in the camp is daring - publicly at least - to look any further than Argentina.  If that is a sensible PR strategy, it doesn't necessarily match that of their support. England have not lost to Argentina in a decade. The Pumas were on a run of 10 consecutive defeats - the worst trot in their illustrious history - before last week's win over Tonga.  Beat Mario Ledesma's men once again here in Tokyo on Saturday afternoon and England will have qualified for the quarter-finals.  \"Argentina are a very passionate nation, and they play with their hearts on their sleeves,\" England skipper Owen Farrell told BBC 5 Live.  \"They have a lot of emotion, they're renowned for their scrummaging and they have backs who can win the ball in the air and create things out of nothing. We're going to have to be at the top of our game.  \"They seem to play their best rugby at World Cups. The Jaguares playing so well in Super Rugby this year [the Buenos Aires-based side reached the final] has obviously put them in good stead coming into this one, and when the majority of your team play together week-in, week-out, it's got to be a good thing.\"  Head coach Eddie Jones has once again opted to pick Farrell at inside centre with his old friend George Ford starting at 10.  With the line-up the same as the one that took Ireland apart in their World Cup warm-up game, bar the addition of Anthony Watson on the wing, it is a settled look for England, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill once again paired in the back row as Jones looks for quick ball and a fast-tempo game.  England have never lost to Argentina at a World Cup, with Ben Youngs - who will become the third most capped England men's player with his 92nd game at scrum-half - the try scorer when his side battled to an unconvincing 13-9 win in Dunedin eight years ago.  England have beaten Tonga and the United States so far at the 2019 World Cup  Jones said: \"We believe that Ford and Farrell is the right way to go at the moment, but we've got other options, which is a great thing for us.  \"You've got to be flexible in your plans. We had our World Cup squad pencilled in three years ago, and each week we've changed it and upgraded it, but we feel like we've got the squad of players here to represent England, and that they're going to play with a lot of passion and pride and brutality.  \"You play against Argentina and they base their game on the scrum. It's the manhood of their approach - you've got to take them on up front, in the scrum, in the maul and at the ruck, that's where it's going to be won.  \"I think they were unlucky to lose to France. The stats suggest they should have won the game, so we've the greatest respect for Argentina.  \"We've worked hard on it and worked hard on creating training situations to handle situations. It's like a tea bag - you don't know how good it is until you put it in the water.\"  Jones has opted for a front row of Joe Marler, Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler and a second row combination of Saracens duo Maro Itoje and George Kruis for a match Argentina replacement hooker Agustin Creevy has predicted will be \"like a war\".  Winger Jack Nowell and prop Mako Vunipola have been selected on the replacements' bench for the first time in the tournament after recovering from long-term injuries, with late squad bolter Lewis Ludlam also getting the nod.  The exclusion of Mark Wilson, one of England's most impressive performers over the past 12 months, is the main surprise, meaning that if anything were to happen to Billy Vunipola, there is no specialist number eight to take his place.  Both Vunipola and Wilson made their England debuts against the Pumas, as did Curry, Underhill and winger Jonny May.  Jones is expecting Argentina to turn back the clock 12 years and revert to the gameplan that got Ledesma and his team-mates all the way to the last four of that tournament, where they were beaten by eventual world champions South Africa.  Jones said: \"They've always had a strong forward pack, and they've changed their approach a little bit to be more of a phase team, and selecting a left-footer at 10 suggests they're going to play a high-kicking game.  \"They were brilliant in 2007. I can remember being with the South African team that met them in the semi-final, and they were a tough team to beat. But like any side they have weaknesses, and we intend to expose those weaknesses.\"  Should England win, a victory over France in their final group game in a week's team could set up a quarter-final with Wales in Oita, with three-time champions New Zealand the possible semi-final match-up.  Argentina must win to have any hope at all. It is why Ledesma is calling Saturday's game his own side's World Cup final. Game over is never far away when the stakes are this high.  'A game England can lose' - Analysis  Former England fly-half Paul Grayson  I don't see Argentina coming up with a full-field gameplan like they did in 2015 which can catch England by surprise.  I think England have got a better 23 when they go head to head. It strikes me as a game England can lose, not Argentina can win.  That dynamic of how emotional the Argentines are\u2026 we see tears in the national anthem when they're playing Tonga. They're odds on to win but they're still getting to that fever pitch, first 20 minutes game done and then that emotion tails away.  Against England, Agustin Creevy will become the most-capped Argentine player in history, you can see them wrapping that up as part of their emotional build-up to the game.  If England are undercooked and Argentina hit the heights they are capable of when they are emotionally at it, it could be tricky for England.  Both 23-man squads, match them up in a joined-up team and you are going to pick a lot of England players.  They need to be emotionally charged and ready to play, but there's no doubt if England play anywhere near their best they should put Argentina away.  Match stats  England have won each of their last nine Test matches against Argentina, their last defeat against the Pumas coming in June 2009 in Salta, a game which took place whilst the British and Irish Lions were touring South Africa.  This will be the third World Cup clash between England and Argentina, England won the previous two meetings in 1995 (24-18) and 2011 (13-9).  England have scored 21 tries and conceded just one in their last three World Cup matches, scoring 4+ tries in three consecutive games for the first time in the tournament.  Argentina's win against Tonga in their last match ended a run of 10 consecutive defeats in Test rugby for the Pumas, their worst ever losing run.

Lawrence, 25, and Bennett, 23, were arrested after a crash in the city on 24 September and are due to appear in court on 15 October.  The Championship club have also ordered the pair to serve 80 hours of community service and rehabilitation.  Derby said the fine was the maximum their contracts allowed.  The incident after a team night out that led to Wales midfielder Lawrence and striker Bennett being charged, also resulted in captain Richard Keogh being sidelined for up to 15 months with a knee injury.  The Rams said they had now completed their internal disciplinary hearing regarding Lawrence and Bennett, who will also have to attend a drink aware course as part of their rehabilitation.  \"The club will not tolerate any of its players or staff behaving in a manner which puts themselves, their colleagues, and members of the general public at risk of injury or worse, or which brings the club into disrepute,\" a statement said.  Both players were left out of last weekend's squad, but returned to play in Wednesday's draw at Barnsley and could feature at Pride Park on Saturday against Luton.  'I let you all down'  Bennett, who is Derby's youngest-ever player having made his debut at the age of 15, also released a statement saying that he \"should have known better\".  \"On the night of Tuesday, 24 September, I made huge mistakes after consuming alcohol,\" the statement said. \"What I did was wrong.  \"Being a footballer and someone who young fans look up to, I know the example I set is key. I am ashamed.  \"At 23 I am old enough, and I was brought up, to know better.  \"I understand that such actions have serious consequences. I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the punishment that the club has issued.  \"I have to and will learn from these events and will strive to be a better person.  \"There's no excuse for what I've done. I'm sorry to my family, my friends, the club, all Derby supporters and to the wider football community, I let you all down.\"", "company": "bbc"}, {"published": "2019-10-04T21:09:27", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/athletics/49942110", "title": "World Athletics Championships: Katarina Johnson-Thompson reacts to Liverpool hometown celebrations", "text": "Heptathlon World Champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson reacts to the celebrations in hometown Liverpool and a special message from Reds' manager Jurgen Klopp.  Available to UK users only.
